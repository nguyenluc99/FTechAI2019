Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 
CHAPTER ONE 
THE BOY WHO LIVED 
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. 
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. 
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that. 
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. 
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. 
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive. 
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. 
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... 
yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. 
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. 
He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. 
"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry" 
Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. 
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks... 
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. 
"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!" 
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. 
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination. 
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. 
"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. 
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word ("Won't!"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: "And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself a grin. 
"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?" 
"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight." 
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters... 
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?" 
As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister. 
"No," she said sharply. "Why?" 
"Funny stuff on the news," Mr. Dursley mumbled. "Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..." 
"So?" snapped Mrs. Dursley. 
"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd." 
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name "Potter." He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, "Their son -- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?" 
"I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. 
"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?" 
"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me." 
"Oh, yes," said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. "Yes, I quite agree." 
He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. 
While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. 
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. 
Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it. 
The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them.... 
How very wrong he was. 
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. 
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. 
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. 
His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore. 
Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, "I should have known." 
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. 
"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall." 
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. 
"How did you know it was me?" she asked. 
"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly." 
"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said Professor McGonagall. 
"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here." 
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. 
"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," she said impatiently. 
"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news." She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. "I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense." 
"You can't blame them," said Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years." 
"I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "But that's no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors." 
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. "A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?" 
"It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore. "We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?" 
"A what?" 
"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of" 
"No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. "As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -" 
"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort." Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. "It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name. 
"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. "But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of." 
"You flatter me," said Dumbledore calmly. "Voldemort had powers I will never have." 
"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them." 
"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs." 
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, "The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?" 
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. 
"What they're saying," she pressed on, "is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. � 
Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. 
"Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it... 
Oh, Albus..." 
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. "I know... I know..." he said heavily. 
Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. "That's not all. 
They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone. 
Dumbledore nodded glumly. 
"It's -- it's true?" faltered Professor McGonagall. "After all he's done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?" 
"We can only guess," said Dumbledore. "We may never know." 
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. 
It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, "Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?" 
"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?" 
"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now." 
"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. 
"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. 
Harry Potter come and live here!" 
"It's the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter." 
"A letter?" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. "Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!" 
"Exactly," said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. "It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?" 
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, "Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. 
"Hagrid's bringing him." 
"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?" 
I would trust Hagrid with my life," said Dumbledore. 
"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place," said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?" 
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. 
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. 
"Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. "At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?" 
"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit," said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. "Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I've got him, sir." 
"No problems, were there?" 
"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol." 
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. 
"Is that where -?" whispered Professor McGonagall. 
"Yes," said Dumbledore. "He'll have that scar forever." 
"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?" 
"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with." 
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house. 
"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. 
"Shhh!" hissed Professor McGonagall, "you'll wake the Muggles!" 
"S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. "But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead -- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -" 
"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out. 
"Well," said Dumbledore finally, "that's that. We've no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations." 
"Yeah," said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, "I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir." 
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. 
"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. 
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. 
"Good luck, Harry," he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. 
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!" 
CHAPTER TWO 
THE VANISHING GLASS 
Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. 
Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. 
The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. 
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. 
"Up! Get up! Now!" 
Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. 
"Up!" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. 
His aunt was back outside the door. 
"Are you up yet?" she demanded. 
"Nearly," said Harry. 
"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday." 
Harry groaned. 
"What did you say?" his aunt snapped through the door. 
"Nothing, nothing..." 
Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. 
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. 
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. 
"In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask questions." 
Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. 
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. 
"Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. 
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place. 
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. 
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. 
His face fell. 
"Thirty-six," he said, looking up at his mother and father. "That's two less than last year." 
"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy." 
"All right, thirty-seven then," said Dudley, going red in the face. 
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. 
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, "And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right'' Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, "So I'll have thirty ... thirty..." 
"Thirty-nine, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia. 
"Oh." Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. "All right then." 
Uncle Vernon chuckled. "Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!" He ruffled Dudley's hair. 
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. 
"Bad news, Vernon," she said. "Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him." She jerked her head in Harry's direction. 
Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned. 
"Now what?" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. 
"We could phone Marge," Uncle Vernon suggested. 
"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy." 
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug. 
"What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?" 
"On vacation in Majorca," snapped Aunt Petunia. 
"You could just leave me here," Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer). 
Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. 
"And come back and find the house in ruins?" she snarled. 
"I won't blow up the house," said Harry, but they weren't listening. 
"I suppose we could take him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slowly, "... 
and leave him in the car...." 
"That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone...." 
Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. 
"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!" she cried, flinging her arms around him. 
"I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. "He always sp- spoils everything!" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms. 
Just then, the doorbell rang -- "Oh, good Lord, they're here!" said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. 
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. 
"I'm warning you," he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, "I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas." 
"I'm not going to do anything," said Harry, "honestly.. 
But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. 
The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. 
Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left "to hide that horrible scar." Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. 
Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. 
Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. 
On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump. 
But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room. 
While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. 
"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums," he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. 
I had a dream about a motorcycle," said Harry, remembering suddenly. "It was flying." 
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: "MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!" 
Dudley and Piers sniggered. 
I know they don't," said Harry. "It was only a dream." 
But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. 
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond. 
Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. 
Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. 
After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. 
Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. 
"Make it move," he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge. 
"Do it again," Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. 
"This is boring," Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. 
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. 
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. 
It winked. 
Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. 
The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: "I get that all the time. 
"I know," Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. "It must be really annoying." 
The snake nodded vigorously. 
"Where do you come from, anyway?" Harry asked. 
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. 
Boa Constrictor, Brazil. 
"Was it nice there?" 
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. "Oh, I see -- so you've never been to Brazil?" 
As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. 
"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!" 
Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. 
"Out of the way, you," he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. 
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. 
As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, "Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo." 
The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. 
"But the glass," he kept saying, "where did the glass go?" 
The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, "Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?" 
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, "Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. 
Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. 
He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. 
When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. 
At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang. 
CHAPTER THREE 
THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE 
The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. 
Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting. 
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. 
"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall," 
he told Harry. "Want to come upstairs and practice?" 
"No, thanks," said Harry. "The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick." Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said. 
One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years. 
That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. 
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. 
There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. 
"What's this?" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. 
"Your new school uniform," she said. 
Harry looked in the bowl again. 
"Oh," he said, "I didn't realize it had to be so wet." 
"DotA be stupid," snapped Aunt Petunia. "I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished." 
Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. 
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. 
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. 
"Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. 
"Make Harry get it." 
"Get the mail, Harry." 
"Make Dudley get it." 
"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley." 
Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and -- a letter for Harry. 
Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. 
Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. 
"Hurry up, boy!" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. "What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?" He chuckled at his own joke. 
Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. 
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. 
"Marge's ill," he informed Aunt Petunia. "Ate a funny whelk. --." 
"Dad!" said Dudley suddenly. "Dad, Harry's got something!" 
Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. 
"That's mine!" said Harry, trying to snatch it back. 
"Who'd be writing to you?" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. 
"P-P-Petunia!" he gasped. 
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. 
"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!" 
They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. 
"I want to read that letter," he said loudly. want to read it," said Harry furiously, "as it's mine." 
"Get out, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. 
Harry didn't move. 
I WANT MY LETTER!" he shouted. 
"Let me see it!" demanded Dudley. 
"OUT!" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. 
"Vernon," Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, "look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house?" 
"Watching -- spying -- might be following us," muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. 
"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't want --" 
Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. 
"No," he said finally. "No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer... Yes, that's best... we won't do anything.... 
"But --" 
"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?" 
That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. 
"Where's my letter?" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. "Who's writing to me?" 
"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake," said Uncle Vernon shortly. 
"I have burned it." 
"It was not a mistake," said Harry angrily, "it had my cupboard on it." 
"SILENCE!" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. 
"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking... you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom. 
"Why?" said Harry. 
"Don't ask questions!" snapped his uncle. "Take this stuff upstairs, now." 
The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched. 
From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't want him in there... I need that room... make him get out...." 
Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. 
Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. 
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, "There's another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'� 
With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand. 
"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom," he wheezed at Harry. 
"Dudley -- go -- just go." 
Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had a plan. 
The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. 
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door -- Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap. 
Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. 
I want --" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. 
"See," he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, "if they can't deliver them they'll just give up." 
"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon." 
"Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. 
On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. 
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed "Tiptoe Through the Tulips" 
as he worked, and jumped at small noises. 
On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. 
"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?" Dudley asked Harry in amazement. 
On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. 
"No post on Sundays," he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, "no damn letters today --" 
Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one. 
"Out! OUT!" 
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. 
When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. 
"That does it," said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!" 
He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. 
Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. 
They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. "Shake'em off... shake 'em off," he would mutter whenever he did this. 
They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. 
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.... 
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. 
"'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred of these at the front desk." 
She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. 
"I'll take them," said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. 
Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. 
"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. 
It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled. 
"It's Monday," he told his mother. "The Great Humberto's on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television. � 
Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. 
Still, you weren't eleven every day. 
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought. 
"Found the perfect place!" he said. "Come on! Everyone out!" 
It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. 
"Storm forecast for tonight!" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. "And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!" 
A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. 
"I've already got us some rations," said Uncle Vernon, "so all aboard!" 
It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. 
The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. 
Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. 
"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?" he said cheerfully. 
He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all. 
As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. 
The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. 
Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. 
Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow. 
Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten... 
nine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two... 
one... 
BOOM. 
The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in. 
CHAPTER FOUR 
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 
BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. "Where's the cannon?" he said stupidly. 
There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. 
"Who's there?" he shouted. "I warn you -- I'm armed!" 
There was a pause. Then � 
SMASH! 
The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. 
A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. 
The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. 
"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy journey..." 
He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. 
"Budge up, yeh great lump," said the stranger. 
Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. 
"An' here's Harry!" said the giant. 
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. 
"Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby," said the giant. "Yeh look a lot like yet dad, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes." 
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. 
I demand that you leave at once, sit!" he said. "You are breaking and entering!" 
"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune," said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. 
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. 
"Anyway -- Harry," said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, "a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on it at some point, but it'll taste all right." 
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. 
Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, "Who are you?" 
The giant chuckled. 
"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts." 
He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm. 
"What about that tea then, eh?" he said, rubbing his hands together. 
"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind." 
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath. 
The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, "Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley." 
The giant chuckled darkly. 
"Yet great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don' worry." 
He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, "I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are." 
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. 
"Call me Hagrid," he said, "everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course. 
"Er -- no," said Harry. 
Hagrid looked shocked. 
"Sorry," Harry said quickly. 
"Sony?" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. "It' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all?" 
"All what?" asked Harry. 
"ALL WHAT?" Hagrid thundered. "Now wait jus' one second!" 
He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. 
The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. 
"Do you mean ter tell me," he growled at the Dursleys, "that this boy -- this boy! -- knows nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?" 
Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad. 
"I know some things," he said. "I can, you know, do math and stuff." But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, "About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents' world." 
"What world?" 
Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. 
"DURSLEY!" he boomed. 
Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like "Mimblewimble." Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. 
"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad," he said. "I mean, they're famous. You're famous." 
"What? My -- my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?" 
"Yeh don' know... yeh don' know..." Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. 
"Yeh don' know what yeh are?" he said finally. 
Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. 
"Stop!" he commanded. "Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!" 
A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. 
"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An' you've kept it from him all these years?" 
"Kept what from me?" said Harry eagerly. 
"STOP! I FORBID YOU!" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. 
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. 
"Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh," said Hagrid. "Harry -- yet a wizard." 
There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. 
"-- a what?" gasped Harry. 
"A wizard, o' course," said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter." 
Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. 
Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. 
Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, "What does it mean, they await my owl?" 
"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me," said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment. 
With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. 
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. 
Weather's horrible. Hope you're Well. 
Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. 
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. 
"Where was I?" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. 
"He's not going," he said. 
Hagrid grunted. 
"I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him," he said. 
"A what?" said Harry, interested. 
"A Muggle," said Hagrid, "it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern. 
An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on." 
"We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish," said Uncle Vernon, "swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!" 
"You knew?" said Harry. "You knew I'm a -- a wizard?" 
"Knew!" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. "Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!" 
She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. 
"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!" 
Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, "Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!" 
"CAR CRASH!" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. "How could a car crash kill Lily an' James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!" "But why? What happened?" Harry asked urgently. 
The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious. 
"I never expected this," he said, in a low, worried voice. "I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin'." 
He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. 
"Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can't tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...." 
He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, "It begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows --" 
"Who? � 
"Well -- I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does." 
"Why not?" 
"Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was..." 
Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. 
"Could you write it down?" Harry suggested. 
"Nah -can't spell it. All right -- Voldemort. " Hagrid shuddered. "Don' make me say it again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too -- some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin' himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened. He was takin' over. 'Course, some stood up to him -- an' he killed 'em. Horribly. One o' the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. 
Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway. 
"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew. 
Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the Dark Side. 
"Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em... maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. 
He came ter yer house an' -- an' --" 
Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. 
"Sorry," he said. "But it's that sad -- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find -- anyway..." 
"You-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then -- an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even -- but it didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the best witches an' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts -- an' you was only a baby, an' you lived." 
Something very painful was going on in Harry's mind. As Hagrid's story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. 
Hagrid was watching him sadly. 
"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders. Brought yeh ter this lot..." 
"Load of old tosh," said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. 
"Now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end --" 
But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, "I'm warning you, Dursley -I'm warning you -- one more word... � 
In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent. 
"That's better," said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. 
Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. 
"But what happened to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?" 
"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see... 
he was gettin' more an' more powerful -- why'd he go? "Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don~ reckon they could've done if he was comin' back. 
"Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers. 
Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry. 
There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on -- I dunno what it was, no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him, all right." 
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? "Hagrid," he said quietly, "I think you must have made a mistake. I don't think I can be a wizard." 
To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. 
"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?" 
Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa constrictor on him? Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. 
"See?" said Hagrid. "Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be right famous at Hogwarts." 
But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight. 
"Haven't I told you he's not going?" he hissed. "He's going to Stonewall High and he'll be grateful for it. I've read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and --" 
"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him," growled Hagrid. "Stop Lily an' James Potter' s son goin' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. 
His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won't know himself. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled--" 
"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" 
yelled Uncle Vernon. 
But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, "NEVER," he thundered, "- INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDOREIN- FRONT- OF- ME!" 
He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers. 
Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. 
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. 
"Shouldn'ta lost me temper," he said ruefully, "but it didn't work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do." 
He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. 
"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts," he said. "I'm -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff -- one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job "Why aren't you supposed to do magic?" asked Harry. 
"Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an' everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore." "Why were you expelled?" 
"It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow," said Hagrid loudly. "Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that." 
He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. 
"You can kip under that," he said. "Don' mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets." 
CHAPTER FIVE 
DIAGON ALLEY 
Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. 
"It was a dream, he told himself firmly. "I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard." 
There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. 
And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn't open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. 
Tap. Tap. Tap. 
"All right," Harry mumbled, "I'm getting up." 
He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. 
Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat. 
"Don't do that." 
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. 
"Hagrid!" said Harry loudly. "There's an owl "Pay him," Hagrid grunted into the sofa. 
"What?" 
"He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper. Look in the pockets." 
Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags... 
finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. 
"Give him five Knuts," said Hagrid sleepily. 
"Knuts?" 
"The little bronze ones." 
Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. 
Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. 
"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy all yer stuff fer school." 
Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. 
"Um -- Hagrid?" 
"Mm?" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. 
"I haven't got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he won't pay for me to go and learn magic." 
"Don't worry about that," said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. "D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?" 
"But if their house was destroyed --" 
"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither." 
"Wizards have banks?" 
"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins." 
Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. 
"Goblins?" 
"Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business." Hagrid drew himself up proudly. "He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts -- knows he can trust me, see. 
"Got everythin'? Come on, then." 
Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. 
"How did you get here?" Harry asked, looking around for another boat. 
"Flew," said Hagrid. 
"Flew?" 
"Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh." 
They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. 
"Seems a shame ter row, though," said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. "If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?" 
"Of course not," said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land. 
"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?" Harry asked. 
"Spells -- enchantments," said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. "They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat." 
Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never had so many questions in his life. 
"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual," Hagrid muttered, turning the page. 
"There's a Ministry of Magic?" Harry asked, before he could stop himself. 
"'Course," said Hagrid. "They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 ' course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice." 
"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?" 
"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country." 
"Why?" 
"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we're best left alone." 
At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. 
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, "See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?" 
"Hagrid," said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, "did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?" 
"Well, so they say," said Hagrid. "Crikey, I'd like a dragon." 
"You'd like one?" 
"Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go." 
They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand "Muggle money," as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. 
People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. 
"Still got yer letter, Harry?" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. 
"Good," said Hagrid. "There's a list there of everything yeh need." 
Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1. Three sets of plain work robes (black) 2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 4.

Harry wondered aloud. 
"If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid. 
Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow. 
"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic," he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. 
Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him. 
"This is it," said Hagrid, coming to a halt, "the Leaky Cauldron. It's a famous place." 
It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. 
For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, "The usual, Hagrid?" 
"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle. 
"Good Lord," said the bartender, peering at Harry, "is this -- can this be --?" 
The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. 
"Bless my soul," whispered the old bartender, "Harry Potter... what an honor." 
He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. 
"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back." 
Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. 
Hagrid was beaming. 
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. 
"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last." 
"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud." 
"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter." 
"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle." 
"I've seen you before!" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement. "You bowed to me once in a shop." 
"He remembers!" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. "Did you hear that? He remembers me!" Harry shook hands again and again -- Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. 
A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. 
"Professor Quirrell!" said Hagrid. "Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts." 
"P-P-Potter," stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, "c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you." 
"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?" 
"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts," muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it. "N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?" He laughed nervously. "You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself." He looked terrified at the very thought. 
But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. 
"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry." 
Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. 
Hagrid grinned at Harry. 
"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'." 
"Is he always that nervous?" 
"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since. 
Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me umbrella?" 
Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. 
"Three up... two across he muttered. "Right, stand back, Harry." 
He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. 
The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. 
"Welcome," said Hagrid, "to Diagon Alley." 
He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. 
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. 
Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring -- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. 
"Yeah, you'll be needin' one," said Hagrid, "but we gotta get yer money first." 
Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, "Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're mad...." 
A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. "Look," Harry heard one of them say, "the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.... 
"Gringotts," said Hagrid. 
They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was - "Yeah, that's a goblin," said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. 
He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. 
So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there. 
"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it," said Hagrid. 
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. 
There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. 
"Morning," said Hagrid to a free goblin. "We've come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe." 
"You have his key, Sir?" 
"Got it here somewhere," said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. 
"Got it," said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. 
The goblin looked at it closely. 
"That seems to be in order." 
"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore," said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. "It's about the YouKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen." 
The goblin read the letter carefully. 
"Very well," he said, handing it back to Hagrid, "I will have Someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!" 
Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. 
"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?" Harry asked. 
"Can't tell yeh that," said Hagrid mysteriously. "Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that." 
Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off. 
At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering. 
Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. 
I never know," Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, "what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?" 
"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it," said Hagrid. "An' don' ask me questions just now, I think I'm gonna be sick." 
He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. 
Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. 
"All yours," smiled Hagrid. 
All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. 
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. 
"The gold ones are Galleons," he explained. "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh." He turned to Griphook. "Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?" 
"One speed only," said Griphook. 
They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. 
Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. 
"Stand back," said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. 
"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there," said Griphook. 
"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?" Harry asked. 
"About once every ten years," said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. 
Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. 
"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut," said Hagrid. 
One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had. 
"Might as well get yer uniform," said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. "Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts." He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous. 
Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. 
"Hogwarts, clear?" she said, when Harry started to speak. "Got the lot here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. � 
In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. 
"Hello," said the boy, "Hogwarts, too?" 
"Yes," said Harry. 
"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands," said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. "Then I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow." 
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. 
"Have you got your own broom?" the boy went on. 
"No," said Harry. 
"Play Quidditch at all?" 
"No," Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. 
"I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?" 
"No," said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. 
"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" "Mmm," said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. 
"I say, look at that man!" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in. 
"That's Hagrid," said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't. 
"He works at Hogwarts." 
"Oh," said the boy, "I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he?" 
"He's the gamekeeper," said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. 
"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed." 
"I think he's brilliant," said Harry coldly. 
"Do you?" said the boy, with a slight sneer. "Why is he with you? Where are your parents?" 
"They're dead," said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy. 
"Oh, sorry," said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. "But they were our kind, weren't they?" 
"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean." 
"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. 
What's your surname, anyway?" 
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That's you done, my dear," and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. 
"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose," said the drawling boy. 
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). 
"What's up?" said Hagrid. 
"Nothing," Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, "Hagrid, what's Quidditch?" 
"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin' about Quidditch!" 
"Don't make me feel worse," said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin's. 
"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed in." 
"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in 'em in a long line 0' Muggles -- look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!" 
"So what is Quidditch?" 
"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules." 
"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?" 
"School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but --" 
"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff" said Harry gloomily. 
"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin," said Hagrid darkly. "There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. 
You-Know-Who was one." 
"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?" 
"Years an' years ago," said Hagrid. 
They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. 
"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley." 
"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances," said Hagrid. "An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level." 
Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either ("It says pewter on yer list"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). 
Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again. 
"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday present." 
Harry felt himself go red. 
"You don't have to --" 
"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'." 
Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. 
"Don' mention it," said Hagrid gruffly. "Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand." 
A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. 
The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. 
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. 
"Good afternoon," said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. 
An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. 
"Hello," said Harry awkwardly. 
"Ah yes," said the man. "Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon. 
Harry Potter." It wasn't a question. "You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work." 
Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. 
"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. 
Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course." 
Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. 
"And that's where..." 
Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger. 
"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly. 
"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do...." 
He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid. 
"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?" 
"It was, sir, yes," said Hagrid. 
"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. 
"Er -- yes, they did, yes," said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. "I've still got the pieces, though," he added brightly. 
"But you don't use them?" said Mr. Ollivander sharply. 
"Oh, no, sit," said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. 
"Hmmm," said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. "Well, now -- Mr. Potter. Let me see." He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. "Which is your wand arm?" 
"Er -- well, I'm right-handed," said Harry. 
"Hold out your arm. That's it." He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, "Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand." 
Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. 
"That will do," he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. "Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave." 
Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. 
"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --" 
Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. 
"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. 
Go on, go on, try it out." 
Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. 
"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple." 
Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... � 
He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, "Curious... curious.. 
"Sorry," said Harry, "but what's curious?" 
Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. 
"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar." 
Harry swallowed. 
"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great." 
Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. 
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. 
"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves," he said. 
He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. 
"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet," said Hagrid. 
Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. 
"Everyone thinks I'm special," he said at last. "All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don't know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died." 
Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. 
"Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact." 
Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. 
"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, " he said. "First o' September -- King's Cross -- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon, Harry." 
The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone. 
CHAPTER SIX 
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 
Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all. 
Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. 
Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. 
On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. 
"Er -- Uncle Vernon?" 
Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. 
"Er -- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts." 
Uncle Vernon grunted again. 
"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?" 
Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. 
"Thank you." 
He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke. 
"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?" 
Harry didn't say anything. 
"Where is this school, anyway?" 
"I don't know," said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. 
"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock," he read. 
His aunt and uncle stared. 
"Platform what?" 
"Nine and three-quarters." 
"Don't talk rubbish," said Uncle Vernon. "There is no platform nine and three-quarters." 
"It's on my ticket." 
"Barking," said Uncle Vernon, "howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see. 
You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother." 
"Why are you going to London?" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. 
"Taking Dudley to the hospital," growled Uncle Vernon. "Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings." 
Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. 
They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. 
"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they?" 
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. 
"Have a good term," said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. 
All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone. 
He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. 
According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. 
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten. 
At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. 
"-- packed with Muggles, of course --" 
Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl. 
Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. 
"Now, what's the platform number?" said the boys' mother. 
"Nine and three-quarters!" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, "Mom, can't I go... � 
"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first." 
What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. 
Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. 
"Fred, you next," the plump woman said. 
"I'm not Fred, I'm George," said the boy. "Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? CarA you tell I'm George?" 
"Sorry, George, dear." 
"Only joking, I am Fred," said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone -- but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere. 
There was nothing else for it. 
"Excuse me," Harry said to the plump woman. 
"Hello, dear," she said. "First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too." 
She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. 
"Yes," said Harry. "The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to --" 
"How to get onto the platform?" she said kindly, and Harry nodded. 
"Not to worry," she said. "All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron." 
"Er -- okay," said Harry. 
He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. 
He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control -- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash -- It didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it. 
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. 
The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. 
Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. 
He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, "Gran, I've lost my toad again." 
"Oh, Neville," he heard the old woman sigh. 
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. 
"Give us a look, Lee, go on." 
The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. 
Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. 
"Want a hand?" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier. 
"Yes, please," Harry panted. 
"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!" 
With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. 
"Thanks," said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. 
"What's that?" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's lightning scar. 
"Blimey," said the other twin. "Are you "He is," said the first twin. "Aren't you?" he added to Harry. 
"What?" said Harry. 
"Harry Potter, "chorused the twins. 
"Oh, him," said Harry. "I mean, yes, I am." 
The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door. 
"Fred? George? Are you there?" 
"Coming, Mom." 
With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. 
Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. 
"Ron, you've got something on your nose." 
The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. 
"Mom -- geroff" He wriggled free. 
"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?" said one of the twins. 
"Shut up," said Ron. 
"Where's Percy?" said their mother. 
"He's coming now." 
The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it. 
"Can't stay long, Mother," he said. "I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves --" 
"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. "You should have said something, we had no idea." 
"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it," said the other twin. "Once --" 
"Or twice --" 
"A minute --" 
"All summer --" 
"Oh, shut up," said Percy the Prefect. 
"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?" said one of the twins. 
"Because he's a prefect," said their mother fondly. "All right, dear, well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there." 
She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. 
"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --" 
"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet." 
"Great idea though, thanks, Mom." 
"It's not funny. And look after Ron." 
"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us." 
"Shut up," said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. 
"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?" 
Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking. 
"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?" 
"Who?" 
"Harry Potter!" 
Harry heard the little girl's voice. 
"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please...." 
"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?" 
"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there - like lightning." 
"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform." 
"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?" 
Their mother suddenly became very stern. 
"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school." 
"All right, keep your hair on." 
A whistle sounded. 
"Hurry up!" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. 
"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls." 
"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat." 
"George!" 
"Only joking, Mom." 
The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. 
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. 
The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. 
"Anyone sitting there?" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. 
"Everywhere else is full." 
Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. 
"Hey, Ron." 
The twins were back. 
"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there." 
"Right," mumbled Ron. 
"Harry," said the other twin, "did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then. 
"Bye," said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. 
"Are you really Harry Potter?" Ron blurted out. 
Harry nodded. 
"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes," said Ron. "And have you really got -- you know..." 
He pointed at Harry's forehead. 
Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. 
"So that's where You-Know-Who "Yes," said Harry, "but I can't remember it." 
"Nothing?" said Ron eagerly. 
"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else." 
"Wow," said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. 
"Are all your family wizards?" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. 
"Er -- Yes, I think so," said Ron. "I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him." 
"So you must know loads of magic already." 
The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. 
"I heard you went to live with Muggles," said Ron. "What are they like?" 
"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers." 
"Five," said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. "I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat." 
Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. 
"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead." 
Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. 
Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. 
"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort" 
Ron gasped. 
"What?" said Harry. 
"You said You-Know-Who's name!" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. "I'd have thought you, of all people --" 
"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name," said Harry, I just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to learn.... I bet," he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, "I bet I'm the worst in the class." 
"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough." 
While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. 
Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. 
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, "Anything off the cart, dears?" 
Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. 
He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. 
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. 
"Hungry, are you?" 
"Starving," said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. 
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, "She always forgets I don't like corned beef." 
"Swap you for one of these," said Harry, holding up a pasty. "Go on --" 
"You don't want this, it's all dry," said Ron. "She hasn't got much time," he added quickly, "you know, with five of us." 
"Go on, have a pasty," said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). 
"What are these?" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. 
"They're not really frogs, are they?" He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. 
"No," said Ron. "But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa." 
"What?" 
"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy." 
Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. 
"So this is Dumbledore!" said Harry. 
"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!" said Ron. "Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. 
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared. 
"He's gone!" 
"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day," said Ron. "He'll be back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you want it? You can start collecting." 
Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. 
"Help yourself," said Harry. "But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos." 
"Do they? What, they don't move at all?" Ron sounded amazed. "weird!" 
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. 
He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. 
"You want to be careful with those," Ron warned Harry. "When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a boogerflavored one once." 
Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. 
"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts." 
They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper. 
The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. 
There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful. 
"Sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?" 
When they shook their heads, he wailed, "I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!" 
"He'll turn up," said Harry. 
"Yes," said the boy miserably. "Well, if you see him..." 
He left. 
"Don't know why he's so bothered," said Ron. "If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk." 
The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap. 
"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference," said Ron in disgust. "I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look..." 
He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. 
"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway He had just raised his 'wand when the compartment door slid open again. 
The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. 
"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one," she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. 
"We've already told him we haven't seen it," said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. 
"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then." 
She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. 
"Er -- all right." 
He cleared his throat. 
"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow." 
He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. 
"Are you sure that's a real spell?" said the girl. "Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard -- I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you. 
She said all this very fast. 
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either. 
"I'm Ron Weasley," Ron muttered. 
"Harry Potter," said Harry. 
"Are you really?" said Hermione. "I know all about you, of course -- I got a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century. 
"Am I?" said Harry, feeling dazed. 
"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me," said Hermione. "Do either of you know what house you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon." 
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. 
"Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it," said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. "Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud." 
"What house are your brothers in?" asked Harry. 
"Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. "Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin." 
"That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?" 
"Yeah," said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. 
"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter," 
said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses. "So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?" 
Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school. 
"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing something for Gringotts," said Ron. "Did you hear about Gringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault." 
Harry stared. 
"Really? What happened to them?" 
"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it." 
Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying "Voldemort" without worrying. 
"What's your Quidditch team?" Ron asked. 
"Er -- I don't know any," Harry confessed. 
"What!" Ron looked dumbfounded. "Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world --" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time. 
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley. 
"Is it true?" he said. "They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?" 
"Yes," said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. 
"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle," said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy." 
Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him. 
"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford." 
He turned back to Harry. "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there." 
He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it. 
"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks," he said coolly. 
Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. 
"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter," he said slowly. "Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you." 
Both Harry and Ron stood up. 
"Say that again," Ron said, his face as red as his hair. 
"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?" Malfoy sneered. 
"Unless you get out now," said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. 
"But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some." 
Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. 
Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. 
"What has been going on?" she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. 
I think he's been knocked out," Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. "No -- I don't believe it -- he's gone back to sleep-" 
And so he had. 
"You've met Malfoy before?" 
Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. 
"I've heard of his family," said Ron darkly. "They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side." He turned to Hermione. "Can we help you with something?" 
"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!" 
"Scabbers has been fighting, not us," said Ron, scowling at her. "Would you mind leaving while we change?" 
"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," said Hermione in a sniffy voice. "And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?" 
Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. 
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. 
Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. 
A voice echoed through the train: "We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately." 
Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. 
The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: "Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Harry?" 
Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. 
"C'mon, follow me -- any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!" 
Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice. 
"Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here." 
There was a loud "Oooooh!" 
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take. 
Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. 
"No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. "Everyone in?" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. "Right then -- FORWARD!" 
And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. 
"Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. 
"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. 
"Trevor!" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. 
They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak front door. 
"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?" 
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door. 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
THE SORTING HAT 
The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross. 
"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall," said Hagrid. 
"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here." 
She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. 
They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. 
"Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room. 
"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. 
"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting." 
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair. 
"I shall return when we are ready for you," said Professor McGonagall. 
"Please wait quietly." 
She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. 
"How exactly do they sort us into houses?" he asked Ron. 
"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking." 
Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived. 
He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. 
Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed. 
"What the --?" 
He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: "Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --" 
"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?" 
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. 
Nobody answered. 
"New students!" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. "About to be Sorted, I suppose?" 
A few people nodded mutely. 
"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!" said the Friar. "My old house, you know." 
"Move along now," said a sharp voice. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to start." 
Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. 
"Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and follow me." 
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. 
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. 
These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. 
Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. 
The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History." 
It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens. 
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house. 
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing: "Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, But don't judge on what you see, I'll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. 
You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. 
There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. 
You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. 
So put me on! Don't be afraid! And don't get in a flap! You're in safe hands (though I have none) For I'm a Thinking Cap!" 
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. 
"So we've just got to try on the hat!" Ron whispered to Harry. "I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll." 
Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. 
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. 
"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!" 
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause -- "HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat. 
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. 
"Bones, Susan!" 
"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. 
"Boot, Terry!" 
"RAVENCLAW!" 
The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. 
" Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" 
became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling. 
"Bulstrode, Millicent" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. 
He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. 
"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!" 
"HUFFLEPUFF!" 
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. "Finnigan, Seamus," the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. 
"Granger, Hermione!" 
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. 
"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat. Ron groaned. 
A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, "GRYFFINDOR," Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to "MacDougal, Morag." 
Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, "SLYTHERIN!" 
Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. 
There weren't many people left now. "Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and then, at last -- "Potter, Harry!" 
As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. 
"Potter, did she say?" 
The Harry Potter?" 
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. 
Hmm," said a small voice in his ear. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting.... 
So where shall I put you?" 
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. 
"Not Slytherin, eh?" said the small voice. "Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!" 
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, "We got Potter! We got Potter!" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. 
He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. 
And now there were only three people left to be sorted. "Thomas, Dean," 
a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. 
"Turpin, Lisa," became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!" 
Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. 
"Well done, Ron, excellent," said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry as "Zabini, Blaise," was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. 
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. 
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. 
"Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! "Thank you!" 
He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. 
"Is he -- a bit mad?" he asked Percy uncertainly. 
"Mad?" said Percy airily. "He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?" 
Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. 
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. 
It was all delicious. 
"That does look good," said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, "Can't you --?" 
I haven't eaten for nearly four hundred years," said the ghost. "I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've in troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower." 
"I know who you are!" said Ron suddenly. "My brothers told me about you -- you're Nearly Headless Nick!" 
"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. 
"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?" 
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted. 
"Like this," he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, "So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost." 
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements. 
"How did he get covered in blood?" asked Seamus with great interest. 
"I've never asked," said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. 
When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- � 
As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. 
"I'm half-and-half," said Seamus. "Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him." 
The others laughed. 
"What about you, Neville?" said Ron. 
"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch," said Neville, "but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad." 
On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-"; "You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- "). 
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. 
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. 
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead. 
"Ouch!" Harry clapped a hand to his head. 
"What is it?" asked Percy. 
"N-nothing." 
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all. 
"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?" he asked Percy. 
"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape." 
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again. 
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. 
"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. 
"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well." 
Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. 
"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. 
"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. 
"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death." 
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. 
"He's not serious?" he muttered to Percy. 
"Must be," said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. "It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least." 
"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed. 
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. 
"Everyone pick their favorite tune," said Dumbledore, "and off we go!" 
And the school bellowed: "Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they're bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we've forgot, just do your best, we'll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot. 
Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. 
Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. 
"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!" 
The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. 
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. 
"Peeves," Percy whispered to the first years. "A poltergeist." He raised his voice, "Peeves -- show yourself" 
A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. 
"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?" 
There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. 
"Oooooooh!" he said, with an evil cackle. "Ickle Firsties! What fun!" 
He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. 
"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!" barked Percy. 
Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. 
"You want to watch out for Peeves," said Percy, as they set off again. 
"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are." 
At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. 
"Password?" she said. "Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. 
Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. 
" Great food, isn't it?" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. 
"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets." 
Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. 
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. 
He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all. 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
THE POTIONS MASTER 
There, look." 
"Where?" 
"Next to the tall kid with the red hair." 
"Wearing the glasses?" 
"Did you see his face?" 
"Did you see his scar?" 
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. 
Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. 
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. 
The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, "GOT YOUR CONK!" 
Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. 
Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick. 
And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. 
They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. 
Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. 
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. 
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. 
"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts," she said. "Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned." 
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. 
After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile. 
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story. 
For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went. 
Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start. 
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. 
"What have we got today?" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. 
"Double Potions with the Slytherins," said Ron. "Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see if it's true." 
"Wish McGonagall favored us, " said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. 
Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps. 
Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig. 
Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. 
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. 
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him. 
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. 
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name. 
"Ah, Yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity." 
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. 
They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. 
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. "As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach." 
More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead. 
"Potter!" said Snape suddenly. "What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?" 
Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air. 
"I don't know, sit," said Harry. 
Snape's lips curled into a sneer. 
"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything." 
He ignored Hermione's hand. 
"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?" 
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. 
"I don't know, sit." "Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand. 
"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?" 
At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. 
"I don't know," said Harry quietly. "I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?" 
A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. 
Snape, however, was not pleased. 
"Sit down," he snapped at Hermione. "For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?" 
There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, "And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter." 
Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. 
"Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?" 
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. 
"Take him up to the hospital wing," Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. 
"You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor." 
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. 
"Doi* push it," he muttered, "I've heard Snape can turn very nasty." 
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? "Cheer up," 
said Ron, "Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?" 
At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. 
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, "Back, Fang -- back." 
Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. 
"Hang on," he said. "Back, Fang." 
He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. 
There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. 
"Make yerselves at home," said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. 
"This is Ron," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. 
"Another Weasley, eh?" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest." 
The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes. 
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch "that old git." 
"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it." 
Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. 
"But he seemed to really hate me." 
"Rubbish!" said Hagrid. "Why should he?" 
Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that. 
"How's yer brother Charlie?" Hagrid asked Ron. "I liked him a lot -- great with animals." 
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. 
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. 
"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you," said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. 
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date. 
"Hagrid!" said Harry, "that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!" 
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for? As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry? CHAPTER NINE 
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 
Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. 
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. 
"Typical," said Harry darkly. "Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy." 
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. 
"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself," said Ron reasonably. "Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk." 
Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom. 
Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. 
Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. 
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. 
Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. 
A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. 
"It's a Remembrall!" he explained. "Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh..." His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, "You've forgotten something..." 
Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. 
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash. 
"What's going on?" 
"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor." 
Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. 
"Just looking," he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. 
At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. 
The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left. 
Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. 
"Well, what are you all waiting for?" she barked. "Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up." 
Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. 
"Stick out your right hand over your broom," called Madam Hooch at the front, "and say 'Up!"' "UPF everyone shouted. 
Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. 
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. 
Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years. 
"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard," said Madam Hooch. "Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three -- two --" 
But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips. 
"Come back, boy!" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and -- WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. 
Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. 
"Broken wrist," Harry heard her mutter. "Come on, boy -- it's all right, up you get.". 
She turned to the rest of the class. 
"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear." 
Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. 
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. 
"Did you see his face, the great lump?" 
The other Slytherins joined in. 
"Shut up, Malfoy," snapped Parvati Patil. 
"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. "Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Parvati." 
"Look!" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. "It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him." 
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. 
"Give that here, Malfoy," said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch. 
Malfoy smiled nastily. 
"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?" 
"Give it here!" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, "Come and get it, Potter!" 
Harry grabbed his broom. 
"No!" shouted Hermione Granger. "Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you'll get us all into trouble." 
Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron. 
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned. 
"Give it here," Harry called, "or I'll knock you off that broom!" "Oh, yeah?" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. 
Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping. 
"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy," Harry called. 
The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. 
"Catch it if you can, then!" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. 
Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist. 
"HARRY POTTER!" 
His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling. 
"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --" 
Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, "-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --" 
"It wasn't his fault, Professor --" 
"Be quiet, Miss Patil "But Malfoy --" 
"That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now." 
Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag. 
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside. 
"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?" 
Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwicles class looking confused. 
"Follow me, you two," said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. 
"In here." 
Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard. 
"Out, Peeves!" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys. 
"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I've found you a Seeker." 
Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight. 
"Are you serious, Professor?" 
"Absolutely," said Professor McGonagall crisply. "The boy's a natural. 
I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?" 
Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. 
"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive," Professor McGonagall told Wood. "Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it." 
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. 
"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?" he asked excitedly. 
"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team," Professor McGonagall explained. 
"He's just the build for a Seeker, too," said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. "Light -- speedy -- we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say." 
I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. 
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks...." 
Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. 
"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you." 
Then she suddenly smiled. 
"Your father would have been proud," she said. "He was an excellent Quidditch player himself." 
"You're joking." 
It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it. 
"Seeker?" he said. "But first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. "Wood told me." 
Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. 
"I start training next week," said Harry. "Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret." 
Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over. 
"Well done," said George in a low voice. "Wood told us. We're on the team too -- Beaters." 
"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year," 
said Fred. "We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us." 
"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school." 
"Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you." 
Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. 
"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?" 
"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you," said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl. 
"I'd take you on anytime on my own," said Malfoy. "Tonight, if you want. 
Wizard's duel. Wands only -- no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?" 
"Of course he has," said Ron, wheeling around. "I'm his second, who's yours?" 
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. 
"Crabbe," he said. "Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked." 
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. "What is a wizard's duel?" said Harry. "And what do you mean, you're my second?" 
"Well, a second's there to take over if you die," said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry's face, he added quickly, "But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway." 
"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?" 
"Throw it away and punch him on the nose," Ron suggested. "Excuse me." 
They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. 
"Can't a person eat in peace in this place?" said Ron. 
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. 
"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --" 
"Bet you could," Ron muttered. 
"--and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be. 
It's really very selfish of you." 
"And it's really none of your business," said Harry. 
"Good-bye," said Ron. 
All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as "If he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them." 
There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn't miss it. 
"Half-past eleven," Ron muttered at last, "we'd better go." 
They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, "I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry." 
A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. 
"You!" said Ron furiously. "Go back to bed!" 
"I almost told your brother," Hermione snapped, "Percy -- he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this." 
Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering. 
"Come on," he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. 
Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. 
"Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells." 
"Go away." "All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so --" 
But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower. 
"Now what am I going to do?" she asked shrilly. 
"That's your problem," said Ron. "We've got to go, we 3 re going to be late." 
They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them. 
"I'm coming with you," she said. 
"You are not." 
"D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up." 
"You've got some nerve --" said Ron loudly. 
"Shut up, both of you!" said Harry sharply. I heard something." 
It was a sort of snuffling. 
"Mrs. Norris?" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark. 
It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. 
"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed." 
"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password's 'Pig snout' but it won't help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere." 
"How's your arm?" said Harry. 
"Fine," said Neville, showing them. "Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute." 
"Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later --" 
"Don't leave me!" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, "I don't want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already." 
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville. 
"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you. 
Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward. 
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room. 
Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by. 
"He's late, maybe he's chickened out," Ron whispered. 
Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't Malfoy. 
"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner." 
It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room. 
"They're in here somewhere," they heard him mutter, "probably hiding." 
"This way!" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor. 
The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle. 
"RUN!" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room. 
"I think we've lost him," Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. 
I -- told -you," Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, "I -- told -- you." 
"We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower," said Ron, "quickly as possible." 
"Malfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Harry. "You realize that, don't you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off." 
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that. 
"Let's go." 
It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. 
It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight. 
"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out." 
Peeves cackled. 
"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty." 
"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please." 
"Should tell Filch, I should," said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. "It's for your own good, you know." 
"Get out of the way," snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake. 
"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!" Peeves bellowed, "STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR" 
Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked. 
"This is it!" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "We're done for! This is the end!" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts. 
"Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!" 
The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. 
"Which way did they go, Peeves?" Filch was saying. "Quick, tell me." 
"Say 'please."' "Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?" 
"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please," said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. 
"All right -please." 
"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. 
"He thinks this door is locked," Harry whispered. "I think we'll be okay -- get off, Neville!" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. "What?" 
Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far. 
They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. 
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. 
Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. 
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. 
Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take Filch. 
They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. 
"Where on earth have you all been?" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. 
"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout," panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. 
It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again. 
"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?" said Ron finally. "If any dog needs exercise, that one does." 
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. "You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?" she snapped. "Didn't you see what it was standing on. 
"The floor?" Harry suggested. "I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads." 
"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something." 
She stood up, glaring at them. 
I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed." 
Ron stared after her, his mouth open. 
"No, we don't mind," he said. "You'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you. 
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts. 
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was. 
CHAPTER TEN 
HALLOWEEN 
Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. 
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. "It's either really valuable or really dangerous," said Ron. 
"Or both," said Harry. 
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. 
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again. 
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. 
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. 
Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. 
It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session. 
Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read. 
"A Nimbus Two Thousand!" Ron moaned enviously. "I've never even touched one." 
They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it. 
"That's a broomstick," he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. "You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren't allowed them." 
Ron couldn't resist it. 
"It's not any old broomstick," he said, "it's a Nimbus Two Thousand. 
What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?" Ron grinned at Harry. "Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the Nimbus." 
"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle," Malfoy snapped back. "I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig." 
Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow. 
"Not arguing, I hope, boys?" he squeaked. 
"Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor," said Malfoy quickly. 
"Yes, yes, that's right," said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. 
"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?" 
"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit," said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy's face. "And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I've got it," he added. 
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion. "Well, it's true," Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, "If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouln't be on the team...." 
"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand. 
"I thought you weren't speaking to us?" said Harry. 
"Yes, don't stop now," said Ron, "it's doing us so much good." 
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. 
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. 
"Wow," Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread. 
Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top. 
As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. 
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. 
"Hey, Potter, come down!' Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him. 
"Very nice," said Wood, his eyes glinting. "I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week." 
He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. 
"Right," said Wood. "Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. 
Three of them are called Chasers." 
"Three Chasers," Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. 
"This ball's called the Quaffle," said Wood. "The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?" 
"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score," 
Harry recited. "So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?" 
"What's basketball?" said Wood curiously. "Never mind," said Harry quickly. 
"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -I'm Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring." 
"Three Chasers, one Keeper," said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. "And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box. 
"I'll show you now," said Wood. "Take this." 
He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. 
"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do," Wood said. "These two are the Bludgers." 
He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. 
"Stand back," Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers. 
At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. 
"See?" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. "The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So -- think you've got all that?" 
"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team," Harry reeled off. 
"Very good," said Wood. 
"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. 
"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open." 
"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves." 
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. 
Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings. 
"This," said Wood, "is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. "Well, that's it -- any questions?" 
Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. 
"We won't practice with the Snitch yet," said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, "it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try you out with a few of these." 
He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch. 
Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on. 
"That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year," said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. "I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons." 
Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. 
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived. 
"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!" 
squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. "Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest." 
It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat. 
Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck. 
"Wingardium Leviosa!" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. 
"You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap. "It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long." 
"You do it, then, if you're so clever," Ron snarled. 
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, "Wingardium Leviosa!" 
Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. 
"Oh, well done!" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. "Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!" 
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. "It's no wonder no one can stand her," he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, "she's a nightmare, honestly. � 
Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. 
Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears. 
"I think she heard you." 
"So?" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She must've noticed she's got no friends." 
Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. 
Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds. 
A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. 
Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. 
Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, "Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know." 
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. 
There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence. 
"Prefects," he rumbled, "lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!" 
Percy was in his element. 
"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!" 
"How could a troll get in?" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. 
"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid," said Ron. "Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke." 
They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. 
As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm. 
"I've just thought -- Hermione." 
"What about her?" 
"She doesn't know about the troll." 
Ron bit his lip. 
"Oh, all right," he snapped. "But Percy'd better not see us." 
Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. 
"Percy!" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. 
Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. 
"What's he doing?" Harry whispered. "Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?" 
"Search me." 
Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps. 
"He's heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Ron held up his hand. 
"Can you smell something?" 
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. 
And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. 
It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. 
The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. 
"The keys in the lock," Harry muttered. "We could lock it in." 
"Good idea," said Ron nervously. 
They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. 
'Yes!" 
Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up. 
"Oh, no," said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. 
"It's the girls' bathroom!" Harry gasped. 
"Hermione!" they said together. 
It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. 
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. 
"Confuse it!" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. 
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. 
"Oy, pea-brain!" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. 
"Come on, run, run!" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. 
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. 
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils. 
Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. 
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!" 
The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. 
Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. 
It was Hermione who spoke first. 
"Is it -- dead?" 
I don't think so," said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out." 
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. 
"Urgh -- troll boogers." 
He wiped it on the troll's trousers. 
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. 
They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. 
Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. 
Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind. 
"What on earth were you thinking of?" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. "You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in your dormitory?" 
Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. 
Then a small voice came out of the shadows. 
"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me." 
"Miss Granger!" 
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. 
I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them." 
Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? "If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived." 
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them. 
"Well -- in that case..." said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, "Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?" 
Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. 
"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this," said Professor McGonagall. "I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses." 
Hermione left. 
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. 
"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go." 
They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else. 
"We should have gotten more than ten points," Ron grumbled. 
"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's." 
"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that," Ron admitted. "Mind you, we did save her." 
"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her," Harry reminded him. 
They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. 
"Pig snout," they said and entered. 
The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said "Thanks," and hurried off to get plates. 
But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
QUIDDITCH 
As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. 
The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship. 
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress. 
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. 
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. 
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. 
They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway. 
"What's that you've got there, Potter?" 
It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. 
"Library books are not to be taken outside the school," said Snape. 
"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor." 
"He's just made that rule up," Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. "Wonder what's wrong with his leg?" 
"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him," said Ron bitterly. 
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy ("How will you learn?"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. 
Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it. 
"Better you than me," they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening. 
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. 
He knocked again. Nothing. 
Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes. 
Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages. 
"Blasted thing*," Snape was saying. "How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?" 
Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but -- "POTTER!" 
Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. 
"I just wondered if I could have my book back." 
"GET OUT! OUT!" 
Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs. 
"Did you get it?" Ron asked as Harry joined them. "What's the matter?" 
In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen. 
"You know what this means?" he finished breathlessly. "He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That's where he was going when we saw him -- he's after whatever it's guarding! And Id bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!" 
Hermione's eyes were wide. 
"No -- he wouldn't, she said. "I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe." 
"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something," 
snapped Ron. "I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But what's he after? What's that dog guarding?" 
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind -- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours -- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget. 
The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match. 
"You've got to eat some breakfast." 
"I don't want anything." 
"Just a bit of toast," wheedled Hermione. 
"I'm not hungry." 
Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field. 
"Harry, you need your strength," said Seamus Finnigan. "Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team." 
"Thanks, Seamus," said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. 
By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes. 
Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors. 
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green). 
Wood cleared his throat for silence. 
"Okay, men," he said. 
"And women," said Chaser Angelina Johnson. 
"And women," Wood agreed. "This is it." 
"The big one," said Fred Weasley. 
"The one we've all been waiting for," said George. 
"We know Oliver's speech by heart," Fred told Harry, "we were on the team last year." 
"Shut up, you two," said Wood. "This is the best team Gryffindor's had in years. We're going to win. I know it." 
He glared at them all as if to say, "Or else." 
"Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you." 
Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers. 
Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand. 
"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you," she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. 
"Mount your brooms, please." 
Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. 
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. 
Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. "And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too --" 
"JORDAN!" 
"Sorry, Professor." 
The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. 
"And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve -- back to Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle -- that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead -- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses -- GRYFFINDORS SCORE!" 
Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins. 
"Budge up there, move along." 
"Hagrid!" 
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them. 
"Bin watchin' from me hut," said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, "But it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?" 
"Nope," said Ron. "Harry hasn't had much to do yet." 
"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry. 
Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan. 
"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch," Wood had said. "We don't want you attacked before you have to be." 
When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. 
Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it. 
"All right there, Harry?" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. 
"Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?" 
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear. 
Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch. 
Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed -- WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life. 
"Foul!" screamed the Gryffindors. 
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again. 
Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, "Send him off, ref! Red card!" 
"What are you talking about, Dean?" said Ron. 
"Red card!" said Dean furiously. "In soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!" 
"But this isn't soccer, Dean," Ron reminded him. 
Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side. 
"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air." 
Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. 
"So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating "Jordan!" growled Professor McGonagall. 
"I mean, after that open and revolting foul 'Jordan, I'm warning you --" 
"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession." 
It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt anything like that. 
It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts -- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. 
Lee was still commentating. 
"Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet -- passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose -- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no... 
The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying- him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went. 
"Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing," Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. "If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of his broom... but he can't have...." 
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand. 
"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?" Seamus whispered. 
"Can't have," Hagrid said, his voice shaking. "Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand." 
At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd. 
"What are you doing?" moaned Ron, gray-faced. 
"I knew it," Hermione gasped, "Snape -- look." 
Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. 
"He's doing something -- jinxing the broom," said Hermione. 
"What should we do?" 
"Leave it to me." 
Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. 
Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing. 
"Come on, Hermione," Ron muttered desperately. 
Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. 
Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well- chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape's robes. 
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. 
A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row -- Snape would never know what had happened. 
It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. 
"Neville, you can look!" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes. 
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand. 
"I've got the Snitch!" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion. 
"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it," Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results -- Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione. 
"It was Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you." 
"Rubbish," said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. "Why would Snape do somethin' like that?" 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. 
"I found out something about him," he told Hagrid. "He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding." 
Hagrid dropped the teapot. 
"How do you know about Fluffy?" he said. 
"Fluffy?" 
"Yeah -- he's mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the "Yes?" said Harry eagerly. 
"Now, don't ask me anymore," said Hagrid gruffly. "That's top secret, that is." 
"But Snape's trying to steal it." 
"Rubbish," said Hagrid again. "Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort." 
"So why did he just try and kill Harry?" cried Hermione. 
The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape. 
I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!" 
"I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!" said Hagrid hotly. "I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel --" 
"Aha!" said Harry, "so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?" 
Hagrid looked furious with himself. 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. 
No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. 
Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons. 
"I do feel so sorry," said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, "for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home." 
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. 
Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. 
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family. 
It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. 
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. 
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it. 
"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches. 
"Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron." 
"Would you mind moving out of the way?" came Malfoys cold drawl from behind them. "Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to." 
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. 
"WEASLEY!" 
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes. 
"He was provoked, Professor Snape," said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. "Malfoy was insultin' his family." 
"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid," said Snape silkily. "Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more. Move along, all of you." 
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. 
"I'll get him," said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, "one of these days, I'll get him --" 
"I hate them both," said Harry, "Malfoy and Snape." 
"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas," said Hagrid. "Tell yeh what, come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat." 
So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to -the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations. 
"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?" 
The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. 
"How many days you got left until yer holidays?" Hagrid asked. 
"Just one," said Hermione. "And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library." 
"Oh yeah, you're right," said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree. 
"The library?" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. "Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?" 
"Oh, we're not working," Harry told him brightly. "Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is." 
"You what?" Hagrid looked shocked. "Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'." 
"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all," said Hermione. 
"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?" Harry added. "We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I've read his name somewhere." 
"I'm sayin' nothin, said Hagrid flatly. 
"Just have to find out for ourselves, then," said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library. 
They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. 
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. 
"What are you looking for, boy?" 
"Nothing," said Harry. 
Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. 
"You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!" 
Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to. 
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. 
Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. 
They went off to lunch. 
"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?" said Hermione. "And send me an owl if you find anything." 
"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is," said Ron. 
"It'd be safe to ask them." 
"Very safe, as they're both dentists," said Hermione. 
Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work. 
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. 
Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. 
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. "Don't send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him." On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. 
When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. 
"Merry Christmas," said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. 
"You, too," said Harry. "Will you look at this? I've got some presents!" 
"What did you expect, turnips?" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's. 
Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl. 
A second, very small parcel contained a note. 
We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece. 
"That's friendly," said Harry. 
Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. 
"Weird!" he said, 'NMat a shape! This is money?" 
"You can keep it," said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. "Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?" 
"I think I know who that one's from," said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. "My mom. I told her you didn't expect any presents and -- oh, no," he groaned, "she's made you a Weasley sweater." 
Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. 
"Every year she makes us a sweater," said Ron, unwrapping his own, "and mine's always maroon." 
"That's really nice of her," said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty. 
His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. 
This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. 
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. 
"I've heard of those," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. "If that's what I think it is -- they're really rare, and really valuable." 
"What is it?" 
Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material. 
"It's an invisibility cloak," said Ron, a look of awe on his face. "I'm sure it is -- try it on." 
Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell. 
"It is! Look down!" 
Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely. 
"There's a note!" said Ron suddenly. "A note fell out of it!" 
Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. 
A Very Merry Christmas to you. 
There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak. 
"I'd give anything for one of these," he said. "Anything. What's the matter?" 
"Nothing," said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet. 
"Merry Christmas!" 
"Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!" 
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. 
"Harry's is better than ours, though," said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater. "She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family." 
"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?" George demanded. "Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm." 
"I hate maroon," Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head. 
"You haven't got a letter on yours," George observed. "I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're called Gred and Forge." 
"What's all th is noise. 
Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. 
"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one." 
"I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew. 
"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either," said George. "Christmas is a time for family." 
They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater. 
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him. 
Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. 
When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. 
The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner. 
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much. 
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge. 
It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it. 
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it. 
His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said. 
He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. 
Use it well. 
Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. 
Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back -- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wanted to use it alone. 
He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. 
"Who's there?" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. 
Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. 
He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked. 
The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. 
The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. 
They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all. 
One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be. 
He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. 
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears. 
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. 
"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section." 
Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, "The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them." 
Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak didn't stop him from being solid. 
He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. 
It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way. 
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. 
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. 
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. 
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror. 
She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did. 
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. 
"Mom?" he whispered. "Dad?" 
They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. 
The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. 
How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, "I'll come back," 
and hurried from the room. 
"You could have woken me up," said Ron, crossly. 
"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror. 
"I'd like to see your mom and dad," Ron said eagerly. 
"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone." 
"You can see them any old time," said Ron. "Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?" 
Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? "Are you all right?" said Ron. "You look odd." 
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. 
"I'm freezing," said Ron. "Let's forget it and go back." 
"No!" Harry hissed. I know it's here somewhere." 
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. 
"It's here -- just here -- yes!" 
They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. 
There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him. 
"See?" Harry whispered. 
"I can't see anything." 
"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...." 
"I can only see you." 
"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am." 
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas. 
Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. 
"Look at me!" he said. 
"Can you see all your family standing around you?" 
"No -- I'm alone -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm head boy!" 
"What?" 
"I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too. 
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry. 
"Do you think this mirror shows the future?" 
"How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --" 
"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time." 
"You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents." 
"Don't push me --" 
A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. 
They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking. 
"Quick!" 
Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left. 
"This isn't safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. 
Come on." 
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. 
The snow still hadn't melted the next morning. 
"Want to play chess, Harry?" said Ron. 
"No." 
"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?" 
"No... you go..." 
"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back tonight." 
"Why not?" 
"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?" 
"You sound like Hermione." 
"I'm serious, Harry, don't go." 
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him. 
That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone. 
And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. 
Except -- "So -- back again, Harry?" 
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him. 
" -- I didn't see you, sir." 
"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you," said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. 
"So," said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised." 
"I didn't know it was called that, Sir." 
"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?" 
"It -- well -- it shows me my family --" 
"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy." 
"How did you know --?" 
"I don't need a cloak to become invisible," said Dumbledore gently. 
"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?" 
Harry shook his head. 
"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?" 
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, "It shows us what we want... 
whatever we want..." 
"Yes and no," said Dumbledore quietly. "It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. 
"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?" 
Harry stood up. 
"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?" 
"Obviously, you've just done so," Dumbledore smiled. "You may ask me one more thing, however." 
"What do you see when you look in the mirror?" 
"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks." 
Harry stared. 
"One can never have enough socks," said Dumbledore. "Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books." 
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question. 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
NICOLAS FLAMEL 
Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter. 
"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad," said Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns. 
Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row ("If Filch had caught you!"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. 
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere. 
Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again. 
Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training. 
Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms. 
"Will you stop messing around!" he yelled. "That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!" 
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words. 
"Snape's refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. "When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin." 
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too. 
"It's not my fault," said Wood. "We've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us." 
Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.... 
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her. 
"Don't talk to me for a moment," said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, "I need to concen --" He caught sight of Harry's face. "What's the matter with you? You look terrible." 
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. 
"Don't play," said Hermione at once. 
"Say you're ill," said Ron. 
"Pretend to break your leg," Hermione suggested. 
"Really break your leg," said Ron. 
"I can't," said Harry. "There isn't a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can't play at all." 
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower. 
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. "What happened?" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron. 
"Malfoy," said Neville shakily. "I met him outside the library. He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on." 
"Go to Professor McGonagall!" Hermione urged Neville. "Report him!" 
Neville shook his head. 
"I don't want more trouble," he mumbled. 
"You've got to stand up to him, Neville!" said Ron. "He's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier." 
"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy's already done that," Neville choked out. 
Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry. 
"You're worth twelve of Malfoy," Harry said. "The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin." 
Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog. 
"Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed.... D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?" 
As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card. 
"Dumbledore again," he said, "He was the first one I ever-" 
He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione. 
"I've found him!" he whispered. "I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!" 
Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework. 
"Stay there!" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. 
"I never thought to look in here!" she whispered excitedly. "I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading." 
"Light?" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. 
At last she found what she was looking for. 
"I knew it! I knew it!" 
"Are we allowed to speak yet?" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him. 
"Nicolas Flamel," she whispered dramatically, "is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!" 
This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected. 
"The what?" said Harry and Ron. 
"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look -- read that, there." 
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. 
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). 
"See?" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. "The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!" 
"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!" said Harry. "No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it." 
"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry," said Ron. "He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?" 
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match. 
"I'm going to play," he told Ron and Hermione. "If I don't, all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win." 
"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field," said Hermione. 
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds. 
Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand. 
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. 
"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis," Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. 
"I know," Ron snapped. "Don't nag." 
Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside. 
"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much." 
"The whole school's out there!" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. "Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore's come to watch!" 
Harry's heart did a somersault. 
"Dumbledore?" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. 
There was no mistaking that silver beard. 
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. 
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too. 
"I've never seen Snape look so mean," he told Hermione. "Look -they're off Ouch!" 
Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy. 
"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there." 
Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. 
"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?" 
Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch. 
"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. "It's people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains." 
Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy. 
"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy," he stammered. 
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, "You tell him, Neville." 
"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something." 
Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry. 
"I'm warning you, Malfoy -- one more word "Ron!" said Hermione suddenly, "Harry --" 
"What? Where?" 
Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. 
"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!" said Malfoy. 
Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help. 
"Come on, Harry!" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. 
Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand. 
The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly. 
"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. 
Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe it. He'd done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face. 
"Well done," said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. 
"Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent..." 
Snape spat bitterly on the ground. 
Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. 
Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. 
Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape.... 
And speaking of Snape... 
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on? Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. 
The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree. 
He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too. 
Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying. 
"... d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus..." 
"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private," said Snape, his voice icy. 
"Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after all." 
Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him. 
"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" 
"B-b-but Severus, I --" 
"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell," said Snape, taking a step toward him. 
"I-I don't know what you "You know perfectly well what I mean." 
An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, "-- your little bit of hocus-pocus. 
I'm waiting." 
"B-but I d-d-don't --" 
"Very well," Snape cut in. "We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie." 
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified. 
"Harry, where have you been?" Hermione squeaked. 
"We won! You won! We won!" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. "And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he'll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens." 
"Never mind that now," said Harry breathlessly. "Let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this...." 
He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard. 
"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocuss-- I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through --" 
"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?" said Hermione in alarm. 
"It'll be gone by next Tuesday," said Ron. 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK 
Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet. 
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter. 
Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes. 
Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same. 
"Hermione, the exams are ages away." 
"Ten weeks," Hermione snapped. "That's not ages, that's like a second to Nicolas Flamel." 
"But we're not six hundred years old," Ron reminded her. "Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it A." 
"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They're very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten into me...." 
Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work. 
"I'll never remember this," Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they'd had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming. 
Harry, who was looking up "Dittany" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, "Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?" 
Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat. 
"Jus' lookin'," he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. "An' what're you lot up ter?" He looked suddenly suspicious. "Yer not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?" "Oh, we found out who he is ages ago," said Ron impressively. "And we know what that dog's guarding, it's a Sorcerer's St --" 
"Shhhh!" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. 
"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?" 
"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact," said Harry, "about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --" 
"SHHHH!" said Hagrid again. "Listen - come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh --" 
"See you later, then," said Harry. 
Hagrid shuffled off. 
"What was he hiding behind his back?" said Hermione thoughtfully. 
"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?" 
"I'm going to see what section he was in," said Ron, who'd had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. 
"Dragons!" he whispered. "Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide." 
"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, " said Harry. 
"But it's against our laws," said Ron. "Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania." 
"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?" said Harry. 
"Of course there are," said Ron. "Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. 
Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget." 
"So what on earths Hagrid up to?" said Hermione. 
When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called "Who is it?" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them. 
It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused. 
"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?" 
"Yes," said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. "We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone apart from Fluffy." 
Hagrid frowned at him. 
"0' course I cant, he said. "Number one, I don' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That Stone's here fer a good reason. It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou' Fluffy." 
"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here," said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. "We only wondered who had done the guarding, really." Hermione went on. "We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you." 
Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione. 
"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let's see... he borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o' the teachers did enchantments... 
Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --" he ticked them off on his fingers, "Professor Quirrell -- an' Dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape." 
"Snape?" 
"Yeah -- yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it." 
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything -- except, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy. 
"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren't you, Hagrid?" said Harry anxiously. "And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?" 
"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore," said Hagrid proudly. 
"Well, that's something," Harry muttered to the others. "Hagrid, can we have a window open? I'm boiling." 
"Can't, Harry, sorry," said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too. 
"Hagrid -- what's that?" 
But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. 
"Ah," said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, "That's er..." 
"Where did you get it, Hagrid?" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. "It must've cost you a fortune." 
"Won it," said Hagrid. "Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest." 
"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?" said Hermione. 
"Well, I've bin doin' some readin' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. "Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An' see here -- how ter recognize diff'rent eggs -- what I got there's a Norwegian Ridgeback. They're rare, them." 
He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't. 
"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house," she said. 
But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire. 
So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. 
"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life," Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. 
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. 
He had written only two words: It's hatching. 
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn't hear of it. 
"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?" 
"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing --" 
"Shut up!" Harry whispered. 
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all. 
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited. 
"It's nearly out." He ushered them inside. 
The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it. 
They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath. 
All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes. 
It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. 
"Isn't he beautiful?" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs. 
"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!" said Hagrid. 
"Hagrid," said Hermione, "how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?" 
Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face -- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window. 
"What's the matter?" 
"Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains -- it's a kid -- he's runnin' back up ter the school." 
Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him. 
Malfoy had seen the dragon. 
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him. 
"Just let him go," Harry urged. "Set him free." 
"I can't," said Hagrid. "He's too little. He'd die." 
They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor. 
"I've decided to call him Norbert," said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. "He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where's Mommy?" 
"He's lost his marbles," Ron muttered in Harry's ear. 
"Hagrid," said Harry loudly, "give it two weeks and Norbert's going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment." 
Hagrid bit his lip. 
"I -- I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I can't." 
Harry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, he said. 
"You're losing it, too," said Ron. "I'm Ron, remember?" 
"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. 
We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!" 
"Brilliant!" said Ron. "How about it, Hagrid?" 
And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to ask him. 
The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. 
"It bit me!" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. "I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby." 
There was a tap on the dark window. 
"It's Hedwig!" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. "She'll have Charlie's answer!" 
The three of them put their heads together to read the note. 
Dear Ron, 
How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon. 
Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark. 
Send me an answer as soon as possible. 
Love, 
Charlie 
They looked at one another. 
"We've got the invisibility cloak," said Harry. "It shouldn't be too difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert." 
It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy. 
There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous. 
Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed. 
"It's not just my hand," he whispered, "although that feels like it's about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I've told her it was a dog, but I don't think she believes me -I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this." 
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. 
"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday," said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. 
"Midnight on Saturday!" he said in a hoarse voice. "Oh no oh no -- I've just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert." 
Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep. 
"It's too late to change the plan now," Harry told Hermione. "We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that." 
They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them. 
"I won't let you in," he puffed. "Norbert's at a tricky stage -- nothin' I can't handle." 
When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg. 
"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only a baby, after all." 
The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough. 
They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. 
"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey," said Hagrid in a muffled voice. "An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely." 
From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off. 
"Bye-bye, Norbert!" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. 
"Mommy will never forget you!" 
How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier. 
"Nearly there!" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower. 
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. 
Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. 
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear. 
"Detention!" she shouted. "And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you --" 
"You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming -- he's got a dragon!" 
"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!" 
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. 
"Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!" 
"Don't," Harry advised her. 
Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness. 
Charlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. 
They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much. 
At last, Norbert was going... going... gone. 
They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in detention -- what could spoil their happiness? The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness. 
"Well, well, well," he whispered, "we are in trouble." 
They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower. 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
THE FORIBIDDEN FOREST 
Things couldn't have been worse. 
Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already. 
Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong. 
When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville. 
"Harry!" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. "I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag --" 
Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them. 
"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It's one o'clock in the morning. Explain yourselves." 
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue. 
"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on," said Professor McGonagall. "It doesn't take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I've already caught him. I suppose you think it's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?" 
Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them. 
"I'm disgusted," said Professor McGonagall. "Four students out of bed in one night! I've never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions -- yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor." 
"Fifty?" Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in the last Quidditch match. 
"Fifty points each," said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. 
"Professor -- please "You can't --" 
"Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students." 
A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this? Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done? At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years. 
From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, "Thanks Potter, we owe you one!" 
Only Ron stood by him. 
"They'll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like them." 
"They've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?" said Harry miserably. 
"Well -- no," Ron admitted. 
It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team. 
"Resign?" Wood thundered. "What good'll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?" 
But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him "the Seeker." 
Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence. 
Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.... 
Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice. 
"No -- no -- not again, please --" 
It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer. 
"All right -- all right --" he heard Quirrell sob. 
Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him. 
He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. 
Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling. 
All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given in at last. 
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard. 
"Snape's done it, then!" said Ron. "If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell --" 
"There's still Fluffy, though," said Hermione. 
"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid," 
said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. "I bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?" 
The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. 
"Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure." 
"But we've got no proof!" said Harry. "Quirrell's too scared to back us up. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you think they'll believe, him or us? It's not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think. And don't forget, we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That'll take a lot of explaining." 
Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't. 
"If we just do a bit of poking around --" 
"No," said Harry flatly, "we've done enough poking around." 
He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons. 
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same: Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. 
Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got. 
At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too. 
"Follow me," said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside. 
I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you, eh?" he said, leering at them. "Oh yes... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me.... It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed.... Right, off we go, and don't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do." 
They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted. 
The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut. Then they heard a distant shout. 
"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started." 
Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn't be so bad. His relief must have showed in his -face, because Filch said, "I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy -- it's into the forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece." 
At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks. 
"The forest?" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual. 
"We can't go in there at night -- there's all sorts of things in there -- werewolves, I heard." 
Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise. 
"That's your problem, isn't it?" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. "Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?" 
Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. 
"Abou' time," he said. "I bin waitin' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?" 
"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid," said Filch coldly, they're here to be punished, after all." 
"That's why yer late, is it?" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. "Bin lecturin' them, eh? 'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh've done yer bit, I'll take over from here." 
"I'll be back at dawn," said Filch, "for what's left of them," he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness. 
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. 
"I'm not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice. 
"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts," said Hagrid fiercely. 
"Yeh've done wrong an' now yehve got ter pay fer it." 
"But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do. I thought we'd be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'd tell yer that's how it is at Hogwarts," Hagrid growled. "Copyin' lines! What good's that ter anyone? Yeh'll do summat useful or Yeh'll get out. 
If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack. Go on"' Malfoy didn't move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze. 
"Right then," said Hagrid, "now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow me over here a moment." 
He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest. 
"Look there," said Hagrid, "see that stuff shinin' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery." 
"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?" said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice. 
"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang," said Hagrid. "An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least." 
"I want Fang," said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang's long teeth. 
"All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward," said Hagrid. " So me, Harry, an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other. 
Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an' practice now -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh -- so, be careful -- let's go." 
The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right. 
They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves. 
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. 
"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?" Harry asked. 
"Not fast enough," said Hagrid. "It's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before." 
They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path. 
"You all right, Hermione?" Hagrid whispered. "Don' worry, it can't've gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter -- GET BEHIND THAT TREE!" 
Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away. 
"I knew it, " he murmured. "There's summat in here that shouldn' be." 
"A werewolf?" Harry suggested. 
"That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither," said Hagrid grimly. "Right, follow me, but careful, now." 
They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. 
Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. 
"Who's there?" Hagrid called. "Show yerself -- I'm armed!" 
And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped. 
"Oh, it's you, Ronan," said Hagrid in relief. "How are yeh?" 
He walked forward and shook the centaur's hand. 
"Good evening to you, Hagrid," said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. "Were you going to shoot me?" 
"Can't be too careful, Ronan," said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. 
"There's summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an' Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An' this is Ronan, you two. He's a centaur.)) "We'd noticed," said Hermione faintly. 
"Good evening," said Ronan. "Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?" 
"Erm --" 
"A bit," said Hermione timidly. 
"A bit. Well, that's something." Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. "Mars is bright tonight." 
"Yeah," said Hagrid, glancing up, too. "Listen, I'm glad we've run inter yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?" 
Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. 
"Always the innocent are the first victims," he said. "So it has been for ages past, so it is now." 
"Yeah," said Hagrid, "but have yeh seen anythin', Ronan? Anythin' unusual?" 
"Mars is bright tonight," Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. "Unusually bright." 
"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. "So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?" 
Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, "The forest hides many secrets." 
A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan. 
"Hullo, Bane," said Hagrid. "All right?" 
"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?" 
"Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in here lately? There's a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin' about it?" 
Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. "Mars is bright tonight," he said simply. 
"We've heard," said Hagrid grumpily. "Well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then." 
Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view. 
"Never," said Hagrid irritably, "try an' get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin' closer'n the moon." 
"Are there many of them in here?" asked Hermione. 
"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word. They're deep, mind, centaurs... they know things... jus' don' let on much." 
"D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?" said Harry. 
"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's bin killin' the unicorns -- never heard anythin' like it before." 
They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. 
They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm. 
"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!" 
"You two wait here!" Hagrid shouted. "Stay on the path, I'll come back for yeh!" 
They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them. 
"You don't think they've been hurt, do you?" whispered Hermione. 
"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville... it's our fault he's here in the first place." 
The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. 
What was going on? Where were the others? At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks. 
"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'. Right, we're changin' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry," Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, "but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta get this done." 
So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak. 
"Look --" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. 
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. 
It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves. 
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.... 
Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood. 
"AAAAAAAAAARGH!" 
Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry -- he couldn't move for fear. 
Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure. 
The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. 
"Are you all right?" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet. 
"Yes -- thank you -- what was that?" 
The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead. 
"You are the Potter boy," he said. "You had better get back to Hagrid. 
The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. 
"My name is Firenze," he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back. 
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty. 
"Firenze!" Bane thundered. "What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?" 
"Do you realize who this is?" said Firenze. "This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better." 
"What have you been telling him?" growled Bane. "Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?" 
Ronan pawed the ground nervously. "I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, " he said in his gloomy voice. 
Bane kicked his back legs in anger. 
"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!" 
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. 
"Do you not see that unicorn?" Firenze bellowed at Bane. "Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must." 
And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them. 
Harry didn't have a clue what was going on. 
"Why's Bane so angry?" he asked. "What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?" 
Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. 
"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?" 
"No," said Harry, startled by the odd question. "We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions." 
"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn," said Firenze. "Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips." 
Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight. 
"But who'd be that desperate?" he wondered aloud. "If you're going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?" 
"It is," Firenze agreed, "unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die. 
Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?" 
"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don't understand who --" 
"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?" 
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: "Some say he died. 
Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die." 
"Do you mean," Harry croaked, "that was Vol-" 
"Harry! Harry, are you all right?" 
Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her. 
"I'm fine," said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. "The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there." 
"This is where I leave you," Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. "You are safe now." 
Harry slid off his back. 
"Good luck, Harry Potter," said Firenze. "The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times." 
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. 
Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest. 
Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking. 
"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich...." 
"Stop saying the name!" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them. 
Harry wasn't listening. 
"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so.... Bane was furious... 
he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen.... They must show that Voldemort's coming back.... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.... I suppose that's written in the stars as well." 
"Will you stop saying the name!" Ron hissed. 
"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone," Harry went on feverishly, "then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off... Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy." 
Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort. 
"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic." 
The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over. 
When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it: Just in case. 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 
In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. 
It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell. 
They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. 
Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. 
Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. 
Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest. 
"That was far easier than I thought it would be," said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. "I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager." 
Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. "No more studying," Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. "You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet." 
Harry was rubbing his forehead. 
"I wish I knew what this means!" he burst out angrily. "My scar keeps hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this." 
"Go to Madam Pomfrey," Hermione suggested. 
"I'm not ill," said Harry. "I think it's a warning... it means danger's coming...." 
Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot. 
"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down." 
Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, "That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one." 
Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. 
Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but -- Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. 
"Where're you going?" said Ron sleepily. 
"I've just thought of something," said Harry. He had turned white. 
"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now." 
"Why?" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. 
"Don't you think it's a bit odd," said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, "that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?" 
"What are you talking about?" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer. 
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. 
"Hullo," he said, smiling. "Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?" 
"Yes, please," said Ron, but Harry cut him off. 
"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?" 
"Dunno," said Hagrid casually, "he wouldn' take his cloak off." 
He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. 
"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head -- that's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up." 
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. "What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?" 
"Mighta come up," said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. 
"Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here.... 
He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an' then... I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks.... 
Let's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy..." 
"And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?" Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm. 
"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep --" 
Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. 
"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!" he blurted out. "Forget I said it! Hey -- where're yeh goin'?" 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. 
"We've got to go to Dumbledore," said Harry. "Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak -- it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him. Where's Dumbledore's office?" 
They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. 
"We'll just have to --" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. 
"What are you three doing inside?" 
It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. 
"We want to see Professor Dumbledore," said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. 
"See Professor Dumbledore?" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. "Why?" 
Harry swallowed -- now what? "It's sort of secret," he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared. 
"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago," she said coldly. "He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once." 
"He's gone?" said Harry frantically. "Now?" 
"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time -- "But this is important." 
"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter. 
"Look," said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, "Professor -- it's about the Sorcerer's tone --" 
Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up. 
"How do you know --?" she spluttered. 
"Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone's going to try and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore." 
She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. 
"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow," she said finally. I don't know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected." 
"But Professor --" 
"Potter, I know what I'm talking about," she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine." 
But they didn't. 
"It's tonight," said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. "Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up." 
"But what can we --" 
Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. 
Snape was standing there. 
"Good afternoon," he said smoothly. 
They stared at him. 
"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this," he said, with an odd, twisted smile. 
"We were --" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. 
"You want to be more careful," said Snape. "Hanging around like this, people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?" 
Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. 
"Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you." 
He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. 
Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. 
"Right, here's what we've got to do," he whispered urgently. "One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that." 
"Why me?" 
"It's obvious," said Ron. "You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know." He put on a high voice, "'Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....'� 
"Oh, shut up," said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. 
"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor," Harry told Ron. 
"Come on." 
But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. 
"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!" she stormed. "Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you 've come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!" Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, "At least Hermione's on Snape's tail," when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. 
"I'm sorry, Harry!" she wailed. "Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went." 
"Well, that's it then, isn't it?" Harry said. 
The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. 
"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first." 
"You're mad!" said Ron. 
"You can't!" said Hermione. "After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You'll be expelled!" 
"SO WHAP" Harry shouted. "Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?" 
He glared at them. 
"You're right Harry," said Hermione in a small voice. 
"I'll use the invisibility cloak," said Harry. "It's just lucky I got it back." 
"But will it cover all three of us?" said Ron. 
"All -- all three of us?" 
"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?" 
"Of course not," said Hermione briskly. "How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there might be something useful..." 
"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too." 
"Not if I can help it," said Hermione grimly. "Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not throwing me out after that." 
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. 
Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. 
Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. 
"Better get the cloak," Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't feel much like singing. 
He ran back down to the common room. 
"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --" 
"What are you doing?" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom. 
"Nothing, Neville, nothing," said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. 
Neville stared at their guilty faces. 
"You're going out again," he said. 
"No, no, no," said Hermione. "No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed, Neville?" 
Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. 
"You can't go out," said Neville, "you'll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble." 
"You don't understand," said Harry, "this is important." 
But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. 
I won't let you do it," he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. "I'll -- I'll fight you!" 
"Neville, "Ron exploded, "get away from that hole and don't be an idiot --" 
"Don't you call me an idiot!" said Neville. I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!" 
"Yes, but not to us," said Ron in exasperation. "Neville, you don't know what you're doing." 
He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. 
"Go on then, try and hit me!" said Neville, raising his fists. "I'm ready!" 
Harry turned to Hermione. 
"Do something," he said desperately. 
Hermione stepped forward. 
"Neville," she said, "I'm really, really sorry about this." 
She raised her wand. 
"Petrificus Totalus!" she cried, pointing it at Neville. 
Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. 
Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. 
"What've you done to him?" Harry whispered. 
"It's the full Body-Bind," said Hermione miserably. "Oh, Neville, I'm so sorry." 
"We had to, Neville, no time to explain," said Harry. 
"You'll understand later, Neville," said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak. 
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top. 
"Oh, let's kick her, just this once," Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything. 
They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. 
"Who's there?" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. "Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?" 
He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. 
"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen." 
Harry had a sudden idea. 
"Peeves," he said, in a hoarse whisper, "the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible." 
Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. 
"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir," he said greasily. "My mistake, my mistake -- I didn't see you -- of course I didn't, you're invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir." 
"I have business here, Peeves," croaked Harry. "Stay away from this place tonight." 
"I will, sir, I most certainly will," said Peeves, rising up in the air again. "Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you." 
And he scooted off "Brilliant, Harry!" whispered Ron. 
A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor -- and the door was already ajar. 
"Well, there you are," Harry said quietly, "Snape's already got past Fluffy." 
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. 
"If you want to go back, I won't blame you," he said. "You can take the cloak, I won't need it now." 
"Don't be stupid," said Ron. 
"We're coming," said Hermione. 
Harry pushed the door open. 
As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them. 
"What's that at its feet?" Hermione whispered. 
"Looks like a harp," said Ron. "Snape must have left it there." 
"It must wake up the moment you stop playing," said Harry. "Well, here goes..." 
He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. 
"Keep playing," Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. "I think we'll be able to pull the door open," said Ron, peering over the dog's back. "Want to go first, Hermione?" 
"No, I don't!" 
"All right." Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. 
"What can you see?" Hermione said anxiously. 
"Nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop." 
Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. 
"You want to go first? Are you sure?" said Ron. "I don't know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep." 
Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. 
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. 
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, "If anything happens to me, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?" 
"Right," said Ron. 
"See you in a minute, I hope... 
And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. 
"It's okay!" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, "it's a soft landing, you can jump!" 
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. 
"What's this stuff?" were his first words. 
"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall. 
Come on, Hermione!" 
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side. 
"We must be miles under the school , she said. 
"Lucky this plant thing's here, really," said Ron. 
"Lucky!" shrieked Hermione. "Look at you both!" 
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. 
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. 
"Stop moving!" Hermione ordered them. "I know what this is -- it's Devil's Snare!" 
"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help," snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. "Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!" said Hermione. 
"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. 
"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp "So light a fire!" Harry choked. 
"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!" Hermione cried, wringing her hands. 
"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?" Ron bellowed. "ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?" 
"Oh, right!" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. 
Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. 
"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione," said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. 
"Yeah," said Ron, "and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis -- 'there's no wood,' honestly." 
"This way," said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. 
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough... 
"Can you hear something?" Ron whispered. 
Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. 
"Do you think it's a ghost?" 
"I don't know... sounds like wings to me." 
"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving." 
They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. 
"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?" said Ron. 
"Probably," said Harry. "They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll run." 
He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. 
The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm. 
"Now what?" said Ron. 
"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration," said Hermione. 
They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering? "They're not birds!" Harry said suddenly. "They're keys! Winged keys -- look carefully. So that must mean..." he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes -- look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!" 
"But there are hundreds of them!" 
Ron examined the lock on the door. 
"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle." 
They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. 
Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. 
"That one!" he called to the others. "That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side." 
Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. 
"We've got to close in on it!" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. "Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!" 
Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber. 
They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. 
"Ready?" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. 
The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. 
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces. 
"Now what do we do?" Harry whispered. 
"It's obvious, isn't it?" said Ron. "We've got to play our way across the room." 
Behind the white pieces they could see another door. 
"How?" said Hermione nervously. 
"I think," said Ron, "we're going to have to be chessmen." 
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. 
"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?" The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. 
"This needs thinking about he said. I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces...." 
Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, "Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess --" 
"We're not offended," said Harry quickly. "Just tell us what to do." 
"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle." 
"What about you?" 
"I'm going to be a knight," said Ron. 
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. 
"White always plays first in chess," said Ron, peering across the board. 
"Yes... look..." 
A white pawn had moved forward two squares. 
Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost? "Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right." 
Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. 
"Had to let that happen," said Ron, looking shaken. "Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on." 
Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. 
Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. 
Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. 
"We're nearly there," he muttered suddenly. "Let me think let me think..." 
The white queen turned her blank face toward him. 
"Yes..." said Ron softly, "It's the only way... I've got to be taken." 
"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted. 
"That's chess!" snapped Ron. "You've got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!" 
"But --" 
"Do you want to stop Snape or not?" 
"Ron --" 
"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!" 
There was no alternative. 
"Ready?" Ron called, his face pale but determined. "Here I go - now, don't hang around once you've won." 
He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out. 
Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. 
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway. 
"What if he's --?" 
"He'll be all right," said Harry, trying to convince himself. "What do you reckon's next?" 
"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's." 
They had reached another door. 
"All right?" Harry whispered. 
"Go on." 
Harry pushed it open. 
A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. 
"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one," Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. "Come on, I can't breathe." 
He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. 
"Snape's," said Harry. "What do we have to do?" 
They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. 
They were trapped. 
"Look!" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line. 
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine's left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight. 
Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing. 
"Brilliant," said Hermione. "This isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle. 
A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever." 
"But so will we, won't we?" "Of course not," said Hermione. "Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple." 
"But how do we know which to drink?" 
"Give me a minute." 
Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands. 
"Got it," she said. "The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward the Stone." 
Harry looked at the tiny bottle. 
"There's only enough there for one of us," he said. "That's hardly one swallow." 
They looked at each other. 
"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?" 
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line. 
"You drink that," said Harry. "No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really." 
"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?" 
"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn't I?" said Harry, pointing at his scar. 
"I might get lucky again." 
Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him. 
"Hermione!" 
"Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know." 
"I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. 
"Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!" 
"You drink first," said Harry. "You are sure which is which, aren't you?" 
"Positive," said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. 
"It's not poison?" said Harry anxiously. 
"No -- but it's like ice." 
"Quick, go, before it wears off." 
"Good luck -- take care." 
"GO!" 
Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire. 
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. 
"Here I come," he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp. 
It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber. 
There was already someone there -- but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even Voldemort. 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
THE MAN WITH TWO FACES It was Quirrell. 
"You!" gasped Harry. 
Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all. 
"Me," he said calmly. "I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here, Potter." 
"But I thought -- Snape --" 
"Severus?" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. "Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?" 
Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't. 
"But Snape tried to kill me!" 
"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you." 
"Snape was trying to save me?" 
"Of course," said Quirrell coolly. "\Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again. Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular... 
and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight." 
Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. 
"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone." 
"You let the troll in?" 
"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly. 
"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror. 
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. 
It was the Mirror of Erised. 
"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone," Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. "Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this... but he's in London... I'll be far away by the time he gets back...." 
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror. 
"I saw you and Snape in the forest --" he blurted out. 
"Yes," said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. "He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got. 
He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side...." 
Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it. 
"I see the Stone... I'm presenting it to my master... but where is it?" 
Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror. 
"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much." 
"Oh, he does," said Quirrell casually, "heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead." 
"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you...." 
For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face. 
"Sometimes," he said, "I find it hard to follow my master's instructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak --" 
"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?" Harry gasped. 
"He is with me wherever I go," said Quirrell quietly. "I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me." 
Quirrell shivered suddenly. "He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me...." 
Quirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley -how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. 
Quirrell cursed under his breath. 
"I don't understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?" 
Harry's mind was racing. 
What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I'll see where it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to? He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself. "What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!" 
And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself "Use the boy... Use the boy..." 
Quirrell rounded on Harry. 
"Yes -- Potter -- come here." 
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet. 
"Come here," Quirrell repeated. "Look in the mirror and tell me what you see." 
Harry walked toward him. 
I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that's all. 
Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again. 
He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone. 
"Well?" said Quirrell impatiently. "What do you see?" 
Harry screwed up his courage. 
"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore," he invented. "I -- I've won the house cup for Gryffindor." 
Quirrell cursed again. 
"Get out of the way," he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer's Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn't moving his lips. 
"He lies... He lies..." 
"Potter, come back here!" Quirrell shouted. "Tell me the truth! What did you just see?" 
The high voice spoke again. 
"Let me speak to him... face-to-face..." 
"Master, you are not strong enough!" 
"I have strength enough... for this...." 
Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot. 
Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. 
"Harry Potter..." it whispered. 
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move. 
"See what I have become?" the face said. "Mere shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can share another's body... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why don't you give me that Stone in your pocket?" 
So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He stumbled backward. 
"Don't be a fool," snarled the face. "Better save your own life and join me... or you'll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging me for mercy..." 
"LIAR!" Harry shouted suddenly. 
Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling. 
"How touching..." it hissed. "I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your parents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight... but your mother needn't have died... she was trying to protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain." 
"NEVER!" 
Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed "SEIZE HIM!" 
and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering before his eyes. 
"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet' landing on top of him, both hands around Harry's neck -- Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. 
"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!" 
And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. 
"Then kill him, fool, and be done!" screeched Voldemort. 
Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face -- "AAAARGH!" 
Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. 
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the pain in Harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, "KILL HIM! KILL HIM!" and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, "Harry! Harry!" 
He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down... down... 
Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy. 
He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange. 
He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him. 
"Good afternoon, Harry," said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: "Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir, quick --" 
"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times," said Dumbledore. "Quirrell does not have the Stone." 
"Then who does? Sir, I --" 
"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out. 
Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. 
"Tokens from your friends and admirers," said Dumbledore, beaming. "What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it." 
"How long have I been in here?" 
"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried." 
"But sit, the Stone I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say. 
"You got there? You got Hermione's owl?" 
"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you." 
"It was you." 
"I feared I might be too late." 
"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer --" 
"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed." 
"Destroyed?" said Harry blankly. "But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel --" 
"Oh, you know about Nicolas?" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. 
"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best." 
"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?" 
"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die." 
Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face. 
"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them." Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling. 
"Sir?" said Harry. "I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --" 
"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself." 
"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?" 
"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. 
He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power." 
Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, "Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can tell me... things I want to know the truth about...." 
"The truth." Dumbledore sighed. "It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie." 
"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?" 
Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. 
"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry. 
When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know." 
And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. 
"But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?" 
"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good." 
Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, "And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me?" 
"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it." Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "Useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here." 
"And there's something else..." 
"Fire away." 
"Quirrell said Snape --" 
"Professor Snape, Harry." "Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?" 
"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive." 
"What?" 
"He saved his life." 
"What?" 
"Yes..." said Dumbledore dreamily. "Funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt.... 
I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father's memory in peace...." 
Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped. 
"And sir, there's one more thing..." 
"Just the one?" 
"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?" 
"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost my liking for them -- but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't you?" 
He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, "Alas! Ear wax!" 
Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict. 
"Just five minutes," Harry pleaded. 
"Absolutely not." 
"You let Professor Dumbledore in..." 
"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest." 
"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey..." 
"Oh, very well," she said. "But five minutes only." 
And she let Ron and Hermione in. 
"Harry!" 
Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore. 
"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried --" 
"The whole school's talking about it," said Ron. "What really happened?" 
It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud. 
"So the Stone's gone?" said Ron finally. "Flamel's just going to die?" 
"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- 'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. 
"I always said he was off his rocker," said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. 
"So what happened to you two?" said Harry. 
"Well, I got back all right," said Hermione. "I brought Ron round -- that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he just said, 'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the third floor." 
"D'you think he meant you to do it?" said Ron. "Sending you your father's cloak and everything?" 
"Well, " Hermione exploded, "if he did -- I mean to say that's terrible -- you could have been killed." 
"No, it isn't," said Harry thoughtfully. "He's a funny man, Dumbledore. 
I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could...." 
"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right," said Ron proudly. 
"Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but the food'll be good." 
At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. 
"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT" she said firmly. 
After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal. 
I want to go to the feast," he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. I can, can't I?" 
"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go," she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize how risky feasts could be. "And you have another visitor." 
"Oh, good," said Harry. "Who is it?" 
Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears. 
"It's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!" he sobbed, his face in his hands. 
I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter live as a Muggle!" 
"Hagrid!" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. "Hagrid, he'd have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him." 
"Yeh could've died!" sobbed Hagrid. "An' don' say the name!" 
"VOLDEMORT!" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. "I've met him and I'm calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I've got loads...." 
Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, "That reminds me. I've got yeh a present." 
"It's not a stoat sandwich, is it?" said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. "Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got yeh this..." 
It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father. 
"Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos... knew yeh didn' have any... d'yeh like it?" 
Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood. 
Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table. 
When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him. 
Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away. 
"Another year gone!" Dumbledore said cheerfully. "And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts.... 
"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two." 
A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. 
Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight. 
"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin," said Dumbledore. "However, recent events must be taken into account." 
The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little. 
"Ahem," said Dumbledore. "I have a few last-minute points to dish out. 
Let me see. Yes... 
"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley..." 
Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn. 
"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points." 
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, "My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!" 
At last there was silence again. 
"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points." 
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up. "Third -- to Mr. Harry Potter..." said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points." 
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point. 
Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent. 
"There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom." 
Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. 
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him. 
"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, "we need a little change of decoration." 
He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. 
It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight. 
Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life. 
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays ("I always hope they'll forget to give us these," said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station. 
It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. 
"You must come and stay this summer," said Ron, "both of you -- I'll send you an owl." 
"Thanks," said Harry, "I'll need something to look forward to." People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: "Bye, Harry!" 
"See you, Potter!" 
"Still famous," said Ron, grinning at him. 
"Not where I'm going, I promise you," said Harry. 
He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. "There he is, Mom, there he is, look!" 
It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron. 
"Harry Potter!" she squealed. "Look, Mom! I can see "Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point." 
Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them. 
"Busy year?" she said. 
"Very," said Harry. "Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley." 
"Oh, it was nothing, dear." 
"Ready, are you?" 
It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. 
"You must be Harry's family!" said Mrs. Weasley. 
"In a manner of speaking," said Uncle Vernon. "Hurry up, boy, we haven't got all day." He walked away. 
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione. 
"See you over the summer, then." 
"Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday," said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. 
"Oh, I will," said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. "They don't know we're not allowed to use magic at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...." 

THE HOBBIT     OR   THERE AND BACK  AGAIN     J.R.R. TOLKIEN     The Hobbit is a tale of high adventure, undertaken by a company of dwarves, in search of dragon-guarded gold. A reluctant partner in this perilous quest is Bilbo Baggins, a comfort- loving, unambitious hobbit, who surprises even himself by his resourcefulness and his skill as a burglar. Encounters with trolls, goblins, dwarves, elves and giant spiders, conversations with the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent, and a rather unwilling presence at the Battle of the Five Armies are some of the adventures that befall Bilbo. But there are lighter moments as well: good fellowship, welcome meals, laughter and song. Bilbo Baggins has taken his place among the ranks of the immortals of children’s fiction. Written for Professor Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant acclaim when published. It is a complete and marvellous tale in itself, but it also forms a prelude to The Lord of the Rings. ‘One of the most influential books of our generation’ The Times
Thror's Map The Trolls The Mountain-path The Misty Mountains looking West Beorn’s Hall The Elvenkina’s Gate Lake Town The Front Gate The Hall at Baa-End Map of Wilderland NOTE ON THE TEXT The Hobbit was first published in September 1937. Its 1951 second edition (fifth impression) contains a significantly revised portion of 
Chapter V, “Riddles in the Dark,” which brings the story of The Hobbit more in line with its sequel, The Lord of the Rings, then in progress. Tolkien made some further revisions to the American edition published by Ballantine Books in February 1966, and to the British third edition (sixteenth impression) published by George Allen & Unwin later that same year. For the 1995 British hardcover edition, published by HarperCollins, the text of The Hobbit was entered into word-processing files, and a number of further corrections of misprints and errors were made. Since then, various editions of The Hobbit have been generated from that computerized text file. For the present text, that file has been compared again, line by line, with the earlier editions, and a number of further corrections have been made to present a text that, as closely as possible, represents Tolkien’s final intended form. Readers interested in details of the changes made at various times to the text of The Hobbit are referred to Appendix A, “Textual and Revisional Notes,” of The Annotated Hobbit (1988), and J. R. R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography by Wayne G. Hammond, with the assistance of Douglas A. Anderson (1993). Douglas A. Anderson May 2001 Author's Note MI-NWIT pi* t>Mtt.M F + M BFKK PXFI+ This is a story of long ago. At that time the languages and letters were quite different from ours of today. English is used to represent the languages. But two points may be noted. (1) In English the only correct plural of dwarf is dwarfs, and the adjective is dwarfish. In this story dwarves and dvarvish are used-, but only when speaking of the ancient people to whom Thorin Oakenshield and his companions belonged. (2) Ore is not an English word. It occurs in one or two places but is usually translated goblin (or hobgoblin for the larger kinds). Ore is the hobbits’ form of the name given at that time to these creatures, and it is not connected at all with our ore, ork, applied to sea-animals of dolphin-kind. Runes were old letters originally used for cutting or scratching on wood, stone, or metal, and so were thin and angular. At the time of this tale only the Dwarves made regular use of them, especially for private or secret records. Their runes are in this book represented by English runes, which are known now to few people. If the runes on Thror’s Map are compared with the transcriptions into modern letters! ±, the alphabet, adapted to modern English, can be discovered and the above runic title also read. On the Map all the normal runes are found, except S' for X. I and U are used for J and V. There was no rune for Q (use CW); nor for Z (the dwarf-rune A may be used if required). It will be found, however, that some single runes stand for two modern letters: th, ng, ee; other runes of the same kind (''f'ea and Wsf) were also sometimes used. The secret door was marked D M. From the side a hand pointed to this, and under it was written: rihM fftt NiXN ►M MPKT4WRRX MF ft PPfk f&RMm: * The last two runes are the initials of Thror and Thrain.

Chapter I     AN UNEXPECTED PARTY    In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not  a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of  worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare,  sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to  eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means  comfort.   It had a perfectly round door like a porthole,  painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in  the exact middle. The door opened on to a  tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very  comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled  walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided  with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs  for hats and coats — the hobbit was fond of  visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going  fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill  — The Hill, as all the people for many miles  round called it — and many little round doors  opened out of it, first on one side and then on  another. No going upstairs for the hobbit:  bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of  these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms    devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all  were on the same floor, and indeed on the  same passage. The best rooms were all on the  left-hand side (going in), for these were the only  ones to have windows, deep-set round  windows looking over his garden, and  meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.   This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit,  and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses  had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for  time out of mind, and people considered them  very respectable, not only because most of  them were rich, but also because they never  had any adventures or did anything unexpected:  you could tell what a Baggins would say on any  question without the bother of asking him. This  is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure,  and found himself doing and saying things  altogether unexpected. He may have lost the  neighbours’ respect, but he gained — well, you  will see whether he gained anything in the end.   The mother of our particular hobbit — what is  a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some  description nowadays, since they have become  rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us.  They are (or were) a little people, about half our  height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves.  Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no  magic about them, except the ordinary     everyday sort which helps them to disappear  quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like  you and me come blundering along, making a  noise like elephants which they can hear a mile  off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach;  they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and  yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow  natural leathery soles and thick warm brown  hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly);  have long clever brown fingers, good-natured  faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially  after dinner, which they have twice a day when  they can get it). Now you know enough to go on  with. As I was saying, the mother of this hobbit  — of Bilbo Baggins, that is — was the famous  Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable  daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits  who lived across The Water, the small river that  ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in  other families) that long ago one of the Took  ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That  was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was  still something not entirely hobbitlike about  them, and once in a while members of the  Took-clan would go and have adventures. They  discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it  up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were  not as respectable as the Bagginses, though  they were undoubtedly richer.     Not that Belladonna Took ever had any  adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo  Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo’s father, built  the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly  with her money) that was to be found either  under The Hill or over The Hill or across The  Water, and there they remained to the end of  their days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only  son, although he looked and behaved exactly  like a second edition of his solid and  comfortable father, got something a bit queer in  his make-up from the Took side, something that  only waited for a chance to come out. The  chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was  grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and  living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his  father, which I have just described for you, until  he had in fact apparently settled down  immovably.   By some curious chance one morning long  ago in the quiet of the world, when there was  less noise and more green, and the hobbits  were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo  Baggins was standing at his door after  breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden  pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes  (neatly brushed) — Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If  you had heard only a quarter of what I have  heard about him, and I have only heard very little     of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for  any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and  adventures sprouted up all over the place  wherever he went, in the most extraordinary  fashion. He had not been down that way under  The Hill for ages and ages, not since his friend  the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had  almost forgotten what he looked like. He had  been away over The Hill and across The Water  on businesses of his own since they were all  small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.   All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that  morning was an old man with a staff. He had a  tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver  scarf over which his long white beard hung  down below his waist, and immense black  boots.   “Good Morning!” said Bilbo, and he meant  it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very  green. But Gandalf looked at him from under  long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than  the brim of his shady hat.   “What do you mean?” he said. “Do you wish  me a good morning, or mean that it is a good  morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel  good this morning; or that it is a morning to be  good on?”   “All of them at once,” said Bilbo. “And a very  fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors,     into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you,  sit down and have a fill of mine! There’s no  hurry, we have all the day before us!” Then Bilbo  sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his  legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of  smoke that sailed up into the air without  breaking and floated away over The Hill.   “Very pretty!” said Gandalf. “But I have no  time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am  looking for someone to share in an adventure  that I am arranging, and it’s very difficult to find  anyone.”   “I should think so — in these parts! We are  plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures.  Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make  you late for dinner! I can’t think what anybody  sees in them,” said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck  one thumb behind his braces, and blew out  another even bigger smoke-ring. Then he took  out his morning letters, and began to read,  pretending to take no more notice of the old  man. He had decided that he was not quite his  sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old  man did not move. He stood leaning on his  stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying  anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and  even a little cross.   “Good morning!” he said at last. “We don’t  want any adventures here, thank you! You might     try over The Hill or across The Water.” By this  he meant that the conversation was at an end.   “What a lot of things you do use Good  morning for!” said Gandalf. “Now you mean that  you want to get rid of me, and that it won’t be  good till I move off.”   “Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me  see, I don’t think I know your name?”   “Yes, yes, my dear sir — and I do know your  name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my  name, though you don’t remember that I belong  to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To  think that I should have lived to be good-  morninged by Belladonna Took’s son, as if I  was selling buttons at the door!”   “Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not  the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair  of magic diamond studs that fastened  themselves and never came undone till  ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such  wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and  goblins and giants and the rescue of  princesses and the unexpected luck of widows’  sons? Not the man that used to make such  particularly excellent fireworks! I remember  those! Old Took used to have them on  Midsummer’s Eve. Splendid! They used to go  up like great lilies and snapdragons and  laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all     evening!” You will notice already that Mr.  Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to  believe, also that he was very fond of flowers.  ‘‘Dear me!” he went on. “Not the Gandalf who  was responsible for so many quiet lads and  lasses going off into the Blue for mad  adventures? Anything from climbing trees to  visiting elves — or sailing in ships, sailing to  other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite  inter — I mean, you used to upset things badly in  these parts once upon a time. I beg your  pardon, but I had no idea you were still in  business.”   “Where else should I be?” said the wizard.  “All the same I am pleased to find you  remember something about me. You seem to  remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, and  that is not without hope. Indeed for your old  grandfather look’s sake, and for the sake of  poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked  for.”   “I beg your pardon, I haven’t asked for  anything!”   “Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I  give it you. In fact I will go so far as to send you  on this adventure. Very amusing for me, very  good for you — and profitable too, very likely, if  you ever get over it.”   “Sorry! I don’t want any adventures, thank    you. Not today. Good morning! But please  come to tea — any time you like! Why not  tomorrow? Come tomorrow! Good bye!” With  that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his  round green door, and shut it as quickly as he  dared, not to seem rude. Wizards after all are  wizards.   “What on earth did I ask him to tea for!” he  said to himself, as he went to the pantry. He had  only just had breakfast, but he thought a cake or  two and a drink of something would do him  good after his fright.   Gandalf in the meantime was still standing  outside the door, and laughing long but quietly.  After a while he stepped up, and with the spike  on his staff scratched a queer sign on the  hobbit’s beautiful green front-door. Then he  strode away, just about the time when Bilbo  was finishing his second cake and beginning to  think that he had escaped adventures very well.   The next day he had almost forgotten about  Gandalf. He did not remember things very well,  unless he put them down on his Engagement  Tablet: like this: Gandalf Tea Wednesday.  Yesterday he had been too flustered to do  anything of the kind.   Just before tea-time there came a  tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and then  he remembered! He rushed and put on the     kettle, and put out another cup and saucer, and  an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.   “I am so sorry to keep you waiting!” he was  going to say, when he saw that it was not  Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard  tucked into a golden belt, and very bright eyes  under his dark-green hood. As soon as the  door was opened, he pushed inside, just as if  he had been expected.   He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest  peg, and “Dwalin at your service!” he said with  a low bow.   “Bilbo Baggins at yours!” said the hobbit,  too surprised to ask any questions for the  moment. When the silence that followed had  become uncomfortable, he added: “I am just  about to take tea; pray come and have some  with me.” A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it  kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited  dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall  without a word of explanation?   They had not been at table long, in fact they  had hardly reached the third cake, when there  came another even louder ring at the bell.   "Excuse me!” said the hobbit, and off he  went to the door.   “So you have got here at last!” That was  what he was going to say to Gandalf this time.  But it was not Gandalf. Instead there was a very     old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard  and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside  as soon as the door was open, just as if he had  been invited.   “I see they have begun to arrive already,” he  said when he caught sight of Dwalin’s green  hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it,  and “Balin at your service!” he said with his  hand on his breast.   “Thank you!” said Bilbo with a gasp. It was  not the correct thing to say, but they have  begun to arrive had flustered him badly. He  liked visitors, but he liked to know them before  they arrived, and he preferred to ask them  himself. He had a horrible thought that the  cakes might run short, and then he — as the  host: he knew his duty and stuck to it however  painful — he might have to go without.   “Come along in, and have some tea!” he  managed to say after taking a deep breath.   “A little beer would suit me better, if it is all  the same to you, my good sir,” said Balin with  the white beard. “But I don’t mind some cake —  seed-cake, if you have any.”   “Lots!” Bilbo found himself answering, to his  own surprise; and he found himself scuttling off,  too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and then  to a pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed-     cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his  after-supper morsel.   When he got back Balin and Dwalin were  talking at the table like old friends (as a matter  of fact they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down  the beer and the cake in front of them, when  loud came a ring at the bell again, and then  another ring.   “Gandalf for certain this time,” he thought as  he puffed along the passage. But it was not. It  was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods,  silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of  them carried a bag of tools and a spade. In they  hopped, as soon as the door began to open —  Bilbo was hardly surprised at all.   “What can I do for you, my dwarves?” he  said.   “Kili at your service!” said the one. “And  Fili!” added the other; and they both swept off  their blue hoods and bowed.   “At yours and your family’s!” replied Bilbo,  remembering his manners this time.   “Dwalin and Balin here already, I see,” said  Kili. “Let us join the throng!”   “Throng!” thought Mr. Baggins. “I don’t like  the sound of that. I really must sit down for a  minute and collect my wits, and have a drink.”  He had only just had a sip — in the corner, while  the four dwarves sat round the table, and talked     about mines and gold and troubles with the  goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and  lots of other things which he did not understand,  and did not want to, for they sounded much too  adventurous — when, ding-dong-a-ling-dang,  his bell rang again, as if some naughty little  hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off.   “Someone at the door!” he said, blinking.   “Some four, I should say by the sound,” said  Fili. “Besides, we saw them coming along  behind us in the distance.”   The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall  and put his head in his hands, and wondered  what had happened, and what was going to  happen, and whether they would all stay to  supper. Then the bell rang again louder than  ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not  four after all, it was five. Another dwarf had  come along while he was wondering in the hall.  He had hardly turned the knob, before they were  all inside, bowing and saying “at your service”  one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin  were their names; and very soon two purple  hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white  hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they  marched with their broad hands stuck in their  gold and silver belts to join the others. Already it  had almost become a throng. Some called for  ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee,     and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was  kept very busy for a while.   A big jug of coffee had just been set in the  hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the  dwarves were starting on a round of buttered  scones, when there came — a loud knock. Not a  ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit’s beautiful  green door. Somebody was banging with a  stick!   Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry,  and altogether bewildered and bewuthered —  this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever  remembered. He pulled open the door with a  jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other.  More dwarves, four more! And there was  Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and  laughing. He had made quite a dent on the  beautiful door; he had also, by the way,  knocked out the secret mark that he had put  there the morning before.   “Carefully! Carefully!” he said. “It is not like  you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat,  and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me  introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially  Thorin!”   “At your service!” said Bifur, Bofur, and  Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up  two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and  also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel.     This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously  important dwarf, in fact no other than the great  Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not at all  pleased at falling flat on Bilbo’s mat with Bifur,  Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. For one thing  Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin  indeed was very haughty, and said nothing  about service', but poor Mr. Baggins said he  was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted  “pray don’t mention it,” and stopped frowning.   “Now we are all here!” said Gandalf, looking  at the row of thirteen hoods — the best  detachable party hoods — and his own hat  hanging on the pegs. “Quite a merry gathering! I  hope there is something left for the late-comers  to eat and drink! What’s that? Tea! No thank  you! A little red wine, I think for me.”   “And for me,” said Thorin.   “And raspberry jam and apple-tart,” said  Bifur.   “And mince-pies and cheese,” said Bofur.   “And pork-pie and salad,” said Bombur.   “And more cakes — and ale — and coffee, if  you don’t mind,” called the other dwarves  through the door.   “Put on a few eggs, there’s a good fellow!”  Gandalf called after him, as the hobbit stumped  off to the pantries. “And just bring out the cold  chicken and pickles!”     “Seems to know as much about the inside  of my larders as I do myself!” thought Mr.  Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed,  and was beginning to wonder whether a most  wretched adventure had not come right into his  house. By the time he had got all the bottles and  dishes and knives and forks and glasses and  plates and spoons and things piled up on big  trays, he was getting very hot, and red in the  face, and annoyed.   “Confusticate and bebother these  dwarves!” he said aloud. “Why don’t they come  and lend a hand?” Lo and behold! there stood  Balin and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and  Fili and Kili behind them, and before he could  say knife they had whisked the trays and a  couple of small tables into the parlour and set  out everything afresh.   Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the  thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a  stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his  appetite was quite taken away), and trying to  look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and not  in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and  ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At  last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo  made a move to collect the plates and glasses.   “I suppose you will all stay to supper?” he  said in his politest unpressing tones.     “Of course!” said Thorin. “And after. We  shan’t get through the business till late, and we  must have some music first. Now to clear up!”   Thereupon the twelve dwarves — not Thorin,  he was too important, and stayed talking to  Gandalf — jumped to their feet, and made tall  piles of all the things. Off they went, not waiting  for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with  a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the  hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with  fright: “please be careful!” and “please, don’t  trouble! I can manage.” But the dwarves only  started to sing:    Chip the glasses and crack the plates!   Blunt the knives and bend the forks!  That’s i/i hat Bilbo Baggins hates-  Smash the bottles and burn the corks!    Cut the cloth and tread on the fat!   Pour the milk on the pantry floor!  Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!  Splash the 1/1 ine on every door!     Dump the crocks in a boiling bow/;   Pound them up with a thumping pole;  And when you’ve finished, if any are  whole,   Send them down the hall to roll!    That’s what Bilbo Baggins hates!   So, carefully! carefully with the plates!    And of course they did none of these  dreadful things, and everything was cleaned  and put away safe as quick as lightning, while  the hobbit was turning round and round in the  middle of the kitchen trying to see what they  were doing. Then they went back, and found  Thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a  pipe. He was blowing the most enormous  smoke-rings, and wherever he told one to go, it  went — up the chimney, or behind the clock on  the mantelpiece, or under the table, or round  and round the ceiling; but wherever it went it  was not quick enough to escape Gandalf. Pop!  he sent a smaller smoke-ring from his short  clay-pipe straight through each one of Thorin’s.     Then Gandalfs smoke-ring would go green and  come back to hover over the wizard’s head. He  had a cloud of them about him already, and in  the dim light it made him look strange and  sorcerous. Bilbo stood still and watched — he  loved smoke-rings — and then he blushed to  think how proud he had been yesterday  morning of the smoke-rings he had sent up the  wind over The Hill.   "Now for some music!” said Thorin. “Bring  out the instruments!”   Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and  brought back little fiddles; Dori, Nori, and Ori  brought out flutes from somewhere inside their  coats; Bombur produced a drum from the hall;  Bifur and Bofur went out too, and came back  with clarinets that they had left among the  walking-sticks. Dwalin and Balin said: “Excuse  me, I left mine in the porch!” “Just bring mine in  with you!” said Thorin. They came back with  viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin’s  harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a beautiful  golden harp, and when Thorin struck it the  music began all at once, so sudden and sweet  that Bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept  away into dark lands under strange moons, far  over The Water and very far from his hobbit-  hole under The Hill.   The dark came into the room from the little     window that opened in the side of The Hill; the  firelight flickered — it was April — and still they  played on, while the shadow of Gandalf s beard  wagged against the wall.   The dark filled all the room, and the fire died  down, and the shadows were lost, and still they  played on. And suddenly first one and then  another began to sing as they played, deep-  throated singing of the dwarves in the deep  places of their ancient homes; and this is like a  fragment of their song, if it can be like their  song without their music.    Far over the misty mountains cold  To dungeons deep and caverns old  We must away ere break of day  To seek the pale enchanted gold.    The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,  While hammers fell like ringing bells  In places deep, where dark things sleep,  In hollowhalls beneath the fells.     For ancient king and elvish lord  There many a gleaming golden hoard  They shaped and wrought, and light they  caught   To hide in gems on hilt of sward.    On silver necklaces they strung   The flowering stars, on crowns they hung   The dragon-fire, in twisted wire   They meshed the light of moon and sun.    Far over the misty mountains cold  To dungeons deep and caverns old  We must away, ere break of day,   To claim our long-forgotten gold.    Goblets they carved there for themselves  And harps of gold; where no man delves  There lay they long, and many a song  Was sung unheard by men or elves.    The pines were roaring on the height,     The winds were moaning in the night.  The fire ms red, it flaming spread;   The trees like torches blazed with light.    The bells were ringing in the dale  And men looked up with faces pale;  The dragon's ire more fierce than fire  Laid lowtheir towers and houses frail.    The mountain smoked beneath the  moon;   The dmrves, they heard the tramp of  doom.   They fled their hall to dying fall  Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.    Far over the misty mountains grim  To dungeons deep and caverns dim  We must amy, ere break of day,   To win our harps and gold from him!     As they sang the hobbit felt the love of  beautiful things made by hands and by cunning  and by magic moving through him, a fierce and  a jealous love, the desire of the hearts of  dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up  inside him, and he wished to go and see the  great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and  the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear  a sword instead of a walking-stick. He looked  out of the window. The stars were out in a dark  sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of  the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly  in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up  — probably somebody lighting a wood-fire —  and he thought of plundering dragons settling  on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames. He  shuddered; and very quickly he was plain Mr.  Baggins of Bag-End, Under-Hill, again.   He got up trembling. He had less than half a  mind to fetch the lamp, and more than half a  mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the  beer-barrels in the cellar, and not come out  again until all the dwarves had gone away.  Suddenly he found that the music and the  singing had stopped, and they were all looking  at him with eyes shining in the dark.   “Where are you going?” said Thorin, in a  tone that seemed to show that he guessed both     halves of the hobbit’s mind.   “What about a little light?” said Bilbo  apologetically.   “We like the dark,” said all the dwarves.  “Dark for dark business! There are many hours  before dawn.”   “Of course!” said Bilbo, and sat down in a  hurry. He missed the stool and sat in the fender,  knocking over the poker and shovel with a  crash.   “Hush!” said Gandalf. “Let Thorin speak!”  And this is how Thorin began.   “Gandalf, dwarves and Mr. Baggins! We  are met together in the house of our friend and  fellow conspirator, this most excellent and  audacious hobbit — may the hair on his toes  never fall out! all praise to his wine and ale! — ”  He paused for breath and for a polite remark  from the hobbit, but the compliments were quite  lost on poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging  his mouth in protest at being called audacious  and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no  noise came out, he was so flummoxed. So  Thorin went on:   “We are met to discuss our plans, our ways,  means, policy and devices. We shall soon  before the break of day start on our long  journey, a journey from which some of us, or  perhaps all of us (except our friend and     counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may  never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object  is, I take it, well known to us all. To the  estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to one or  two of the younger dwarves (I think I should be  right in naming Kili and Fili, for instance), the  exact situation at the moment may require a  little brief explanation — ”   This was Thorin’s style. He was an  important dwarf. If he had been allowed, he  would probably have gone on like this until he  was out of breath, without telling any one there  anything that was not known already. But he  was rudely interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn’t bear  it any longer. At may never return he began to  feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it  burst out like the whistle of an engine coming  out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang up,  knocking over the table. Gandalf struck a blue  light on the end of his magic staff, and in its  firework glare the poor little hobbit could be  seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a  jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the  floor, and kept on calling out “struck by lightning,  struck by lightning!” over and over again; and  that was all they could get out of him for a long  time. So they took him and laid him out of the  way on the drawing-room sofa with a drink at  his elbow, and they went back to their dark     business.   “Excitable little fellow,” said Gandalf, as they  sat down again. “Gets funny queer fits, but he is  one of the best, one of the best — as fierce as a  dragon in a pinch.”   If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch,  you will realize that this was only poetical  exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to Old  Took’s great-grand-uncle Bullroarer, who was  so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a  horse. He charged the ranks of the goblins of  Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields,  and knocked their king Golfimbul’s head clean  off with a wooden club. It sailed a hundred yards  through the air and went down a rabbit-hole,  and in this way the battle was won and the  game of Golf invented at the same moment.   In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer’s  gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-  room. After a while and a drink he crept  nervously to the door of the parlour. This is what  he heard, Gloin speaking: “Humph!” (or some  snort more or less like that). “Will he do, do you  think? It is all very well for Gandalf to talk about  this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that  in a moment of excitement would be enough to  wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill  the lot of us. I think it sounded more like fright  than excitement! In fact, if it had not been for the     sign on the door, I should have been sure we  had come to the wrong house. As soon as I  clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and  puffing on the mat, I had my doubts. He looks  more like a grocer than a burglar!”   Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and  went in. The Took side had won. He suddenly  felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be  thought fierce. As for little fellowbobbing on the  mat it almost made him really fierce. Many a  time afterwards the Baggins part regretted what  he did now, and he said to himself: “Bilbo, you  were a fool; you walked right in and put your  foot in it.”   “Pardon me,” he said, “if I have overheard  words that you were saying. I don’t pretend to  understand what you are talking about, or your  reference to burglars, but I think I am right in  believing” (this is what he called being on his  dignity) “that you think I am no good. I will show  you. I have no signs on my door — it was painted  a week ago — , and I am quite sure you have  come to the wrong house. As soon as I saw  your funny faces on the door-step, I had my  doubts. But treat it as the right one. Tell me  what you want done, and I will try it, if I have to  walk from here to the East of East and fight the  wild Were-worms in the Last Desert. I had a     great-great-great-grand-uncle once, Bullroarer  Took, and — ”   “Yes, yes, but that was long ago,” said  Gloin. “I was talking about you. And I assure you  there is a mark on this door — the usual one in  the trade, or used to be. Burglar wants a good  job, plenty of Excitement and reasonable  Reward, that’s how it is usually read. You can  say Expert Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar  if you like. Some of them do. It’s all the same to  us. Gandalf told us that there was a man of the  sort in these parts looking for a Job at once,  and that he had arranged for a meeting here  this Wednesday tea-time.”   “Of course there is a mark,” said Gandalf. “I  put it there myself. For very good reasons. You  asked me to find the fourteenth man for your  expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins. Just let  any one say I chose the wrong man or the  wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and  have all the bad luck you like, or go back to  digging coal.”   He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the  dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when Bilbo  tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he  turned and frowned at him and stuck out his  bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight  with a snap. “That’s right,” said Gandalf. “Let’s     have no more argument. I have chosen Mr.  Baggins and that ought to be enough for all of  you. If I say he is a Burglar, a Burglar he is, or  will be when the time comes. There is a lot  more in him than you guess, and a deal more  than he has any idea of himself. You may  (possibly) all live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my  boy, fetch the lamp, and let’s have a little light  on this!”   On the table in the light of a big lamp with a  red shade he spread a piece of parchment  rather like a map.   “This was made by Thror, your grandfather,  Thorin,” he said in answer to the dwarves’  excited questions. “It is a plan of the Mountain.”   “I don’t see that this will help us much,” said  Thorin disappointedly after a glance. “I  remember the Mountain well enough and the  lands about it. And I know where Mirkwood is,  and the Withered Heath where the great  dragons bred.”   “There is a dragon marked in red on the  Mountain,” said Balin, “but it will be easy  enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive  there.”   “There is one point that you haven’t  noticed,” said the wizard, “and that is the secret  entrance. You see that rune on the West side,  and the hand pointing to it from the other runes?     That marks a hidden passage to the Lower  Halls.” (Look at the map at the beginning of this  book, and you will see there the runes.)   “It may have been secret once,” said Thorin,  “but how do we know that it is secret any  longer? Old Smaug has lived there long enough  now to find out anything there is to know about  those caves.”   “He may — but he can’t have used it for  years and years.”   “Why?”   “Because it is too small. ' Five feet high the  door and three may walk abreast ’ say the  runes, but Smaug could not creep into a hole  that size, not even when he was a young  dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of  the dwarves and men of Dale.”   “It seems a great big hole to me,” squeaked  Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and  only of hobbit-holes). He was getting excited  and interested again, so that he forgot to keep  his mouth shut. He loved maps, and in his hall  there hung a large one of the Country Round  with all his favourite walks marked on it in red  ink. “How could such a large door be kept  secret from everybody outside, apart from the  dragon?” he asked. He was only a little hobbit  you must remember.   “In lots of ways,” said Gandalf. “But in what    way this one has been hidden we don’t know  without going to see. From what it says on the  map I should guess there is a closed door  which has been made to look exactly like the  side of the Mountain. That is the usual dwarves’  method — I think that is right, isn’t it?”   “Quite right,” said Thorin.   “Also,” went on Gandalf, “I forgot to mention  that with the map went a key, a small and  curious key. Here it is!” he said, and handed to  Thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate  wards, made of silver. “Keep it safe!”   “Indeed I will,” said Thorin, and he fastened  it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck  and under his jacket. “Now things begin to look  more hopeful. This news alters them much for  the better. So far we have had no clear idea  what to do. We thought of going East, as quiet  and careful as we could, as far as the Long  Lake. After that the trouble would begin — .”   “A long time before that, if I know anything  about the roads East,” interrupted Gandalf.   “We might go from there up along the River  Running,” went on Thorin taking no notice, “and  so to the ruins of Dale — the old town in the  valley there, under the shadow of the Mountain.  But we none of us liked the idea of the Front  Gate. The river runs right out of it through the  great cliff at the South of the Mountain, and out     of it comes the dragon too — far too often,  unless he has changed his habits.”   “That would be no good,” said the wizard,  “not without a mighty Warrior, even a Hero. I  tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting  one another in distant lands, and in this  neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply  not to be found. Swords in these parts are  mostly blunt, and axes are used for trees, and  shields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons  are comfortably far-off (and therefore  legendary). That is why I settled on burglary—  especially when I remembered the existence of  a Side-door. And here is our little Bilbo  Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected  burglar. So now let’s get on and make some  plans.”   “Very well then,” said Thorin, “supposing the  burglar-expert gives us some ideas or  suggestions.” He turned with mock-politeness  to Bilbo.   “First I should like to know a bit more about  things,” said he, feeling all confused and a bit  shaky inside, but so far still Tookishly  determined to go on with things. “I mean about  the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how it  got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and  further.”   “Bless me!” said Thorin, “haven’t you got a     map? and didn’t you hear our song? and  haven’t we been talking about all this for  hours?”   “All the same, I should like it all plain and  clear,” said he obstinately, putting on his  business manner (usually reserved for people  who tried to borrow money off him), and doing  his best to appear wise and prudent and  professional and live up to Gandalfs  recommendation. “Also I should like to know  about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time  required and remuneration, and so forth” — by  which he meant: “What am I going to get out of  it? and am I going to come back alive?”   “O very well,” said Thorin. “Long ago in my  grandfather Thror’s time our family was driven  out of the far North, and came back with all their  wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the  map. It had been discovered by my far  ancestor, Thrain the Old, but now they mined  and they tunnelled and they made huger halls  and greater workshops — and in addition I  believe they found a good deal of gold and a  great many jewels too. Anyway they grew  immensely rich and famous, and my  grandfather was King under the Mountain  again, and treated with great reverence by the  mortal men, who lived to the South, and were  gradually spreading up the Running River as far     as the valley overshadowed by the Mountain.  They built the merry town of Dale there in those  days. Kings used to send for our smiths, and  reward even the least skillful most richly.  Fathers would beg us to take their sons as  apprentices, and pay us handsomely,  especially in food-supplies, which we never  bothered to grow or find for ourselves.  Altogether those were good days for us, and  the poorest of us had money to spend and to  lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just  for the fun of it, not to speak of the most  marvellous and magical toys, the like of which is  not to be found in the world now-a-days. So my  grandfather’s halls became full of armour and  jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy  market of Dale was the wonder of the North.   “Undoubtedly that was what brought the  dragon. Dragons steal gold and jewels, you  know, from men and elves and dwarves,  wherever they can find them; and they guard  their plunder as long as they live (which is  practically for ever, unless they are killed), and  never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed they hardly  know a good bit of work from a bad, though  they usually have a good notion of the current  market value; and they can’t make a thing for  themselves, not even mend a little loose scale  of their armour. There were lots of dragons in     the North in those days, and gold was probably  getting scarce up there, with the dwarves flying  south or getting killed, and all the general waste  and destruction that dragons make going from  bad to worse. There was a most specially  greedy, strong and wicked worm called Smaug.  One day he flew up into the air and came south.  The first we heard of it was a noise like a  hurricane coming from the North, and the pine-  trees on the Mountain creaking and cracking in  the wind. Some of the dwarves who happened  to be outside (I was one luckily — a fine  adventurous lad in those days, always  wandering about, and it saved my life that day)  — well, from a good way off we saw the dragon  settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. Then  he came down the slopes and when he reached  the woods they all went up in fire. By that time  all the bells were ringing in Dale and the  warriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out  of their great gate; but there was the dragon  waiting for them. None escaped that way. The  river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale,  and in the fog the dragon came on them and  destroyed most of the warriors — the usual  unhappy story, it was only too common in those  days. Then he went back and crept in through  the Front Gate and routed out all the halls, and  lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and     passages. After that there were no dwarves left  alive inside, and he took all their wealth for  himself. Probably, for that is the dragons’ way,  he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside,  and sleeps on it for a bed. Later he used to  crawl out of the great gate and come by night to  Dale, and carry away people, especially  maidens, to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all  the people dead or gone. What goes on there  now I don’t know for certain, but I don’t suppose  any one lives nearer to the Mountain than the far  edge of the Long Lake now-a-days.   “The few of us that were well outside sat  and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and  there we were unexpectedly joined by my father  and my grandfather with singed beards. They  looked very grim but they said very little. When I  asked how they had got away, they told me to  hold my tongue, and said that one day in the  proper time I should know. After that we went  away, and we have had to earn our livings as  best we could up and down the lands, often  enough sinking as low as blacksmith-work or  even coalmining. But we have never forgotten  our stolen treasure. And even now, when I will  allow we have a good bit laid by and are not so  badly off’ — here Thorin stroked the gold chain  round his neck — “we still mean to get it back,  and to bring our curses home to Smaug — if we     can.   “I have often wondered about my father’s  and my grandfather’s escape. I see now they  must have had a private Side-door which only  they knew about. But apparently they made a  map, and I should like to know how Gandalf got  hold of it, and why it did not come down to me,  the rightful heir.”   “I did not ‘get hold of it,' I was given it,” said  the wizard. “Your grandfather Thror was killed,  you remember, in the mines of Moria by Azoa  the Goblin .”   “Curse his name, yes,” said Thorin.   “And Thrain your father went away on the  twenty-first of April, a hundred years ago last  Thursday, and has never been seen by you  since — ”   “True, true,” said Thorin.   “Well, your father gave me this to give to  you; and if I have chosen my own time and way  for handing it over, you can hardly blame me,  considering the trouble I had to find you. Your  father could not remember his own name when  he gave me the paper, and he never told me  yours; so on the whole I think I ought to be  praised and thanked! Here it is,” said he  handing the map to Thorin.   “I don’t understand,” said Thorin, and Bilbo  felt he would have liked to say the same. The    explanation did not seem to explain.   “Your grandfather,” said the wizard slowly  and grimly, “gave the map to his son for safety  before he went to the mines of Moria. Your  father went away to try his luck with the map  after your grandfather was killed; and lots of  adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had,  but he never got near the Mountain. How he got  there I don’t know, but I found him a prisoner in  the dungeons of the Necromancer.”   “Whatever were you doing there?” asked  Thorin with a shudder, and all the dwarves  shivered.   "Never you mind. I was finding things out, as  usual; and a nasty dangerous business it was.  Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to  save your father, but it was too late. He was  witless and wandering, and had forgotten  almost everything except the map and the key.”   “We have long ago paid the goblins of  Moria,” said Thorin; “we must give a thought to  the Necromancer.”   “Don’t be absurd! He is an enemy far  beyond the powers of all the dwarves put  together, if they could all be collected again  from the four corners of the world. The one thing  your father wished was for his son to read the  map and use the key. The dragon and the  Mountain are more than big enough tasks for     you!”   “Hear, hear!” said Bilbo, and accidentally  said it aloud.   “Hear what?” they all said turning suddenly  towards him, and he was so flustered that he  answered “Hear what I have got to say!”   “What’s that?” they asked.   “Well, I should say that you ought to go East  and have a look round. After all there is the  Side-door, and dragons must sleep  sometimes, I suppose. If you sit on the door-  step long enough, I daresay you will think of  something. And well, don’t you know, I think we  have talked long enough for one night, if you  see what I mean. What about bed, and an early  start, and all that? I will give you a good  breakfast before you go.”   “Before we go, I suppose you mean,” said  Thorin. “Aren’t you the burglar? And isn’t sitting  on the door-step your job, not to speak of  getting inside the door? But I agree about bed  and breakfast. I like six eggs with my ham,  when starting on a journey: fried not poached,  and mind you don’t break ’em.”   After all the others had ordered their  breakfasts without so much as a please (which  annoyed Bilbo very much), they all got up. The  hobbit had to find room for them all, and filled all  his spare-rooms and made beds on chairs and     sofas, before he got them all stowed and went  to his own little bed very tired and not altogether  happy. One thing he did make his mind up  about was not to bother to get up very early and  cook everybody else’s wretched breakfast. The  Tookishness was wearing off, and he was not  now quite so sure that he was going on any  journey in the morning.   As he lay in bed he could hear Thorin still  humming to himself in the best bedroom next to  him:    Far over the misty mountains cold  To dungeons deep and caverns old  We must away, ere break of day,   To find our long-forgotten gold.    Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears, and  it gave him very uncomfortable dreams. It was  long after the break of day, when he woke up.      
Chapter II    ROAST MUTTON    Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-  gown went into the dining-room. There he saw  nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried  breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the  room, and piles of unwashed crocks in the  kitchen. Nearly every pot and pan he  possessed seemed to have been used. The  washing-up was so dismally real that Bilbo was  forced to believe the party of the night before  had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had  rather hoped. Indeed he was really relieved  after all to think that they had all gone without  him, and without bothering to wake him up (“but  with never a thank-you” he thought); and yet in a  way he could not help feeling just a trifle  disappointed. The feeling surprised him.   “Don't be a fool. Bilbo Baggins!” he said to  himself, “thinking of dragons and all that  outlandish nonsense at your age!” So he put on  an apron, lit fires, boiled water, and washed up.  Then he had a nice little breakfast in the kitchen  before turning out the dining-room. By that time  the sun was shining; and the front door was  open, letting in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo  began to whistle loudly and to forget about the  night before. In fact he was just sitting down to a    nice little second breakfast in the dining-room  by the open window, when in walked Gandalf.   “My dear fellow,” said he, “whenever are  you going to come? What about an early start?  — and here you are having breakfast, or  whatever you call it, at half past ten! They left  you the message, because they could not wait.”   “What message?” said poor Mr. Baggins all  in a fluster.   “Great Elephants!” said Gandalf, “you are  not at all yourself this morning — you have never  dusted the mantelpiece!”   “What's that got to do with it? I have had  enough to do with washing up for fourteen!”   “If you had dusted the mantelpiece, you  would have found this just under the clock,” said  Gandalf, handing Bilbo a note (written, of  course, on his own note-paper).   This is what he read:    “Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo  greeting! For your hospitality our sincerest  thanks, and for your offer of professional  assistance our grateful acceptance. Terms:  cash on delivery, up to and not exceeding one  fourteenth of total profits (if any); all travelling  expenses guaranteed in any event; funeral  expenses to be defrayed by us or our  representatives, if occasion arises and the  matter is not otherwise arranged for.   “Thinking it unnecessary to disturb your  esteemed repose, we have proceeded in  advance to make requisite preparations, and  shall await your respected person at the Green     Dragon Inn, Bywater, at 11 a.m. sharp. Trusting  that you will be punctual,   “ We have the honour to remain  “ Yours deeply  “ Thorin & Co.”   “That leaves you just ten minutes. You will  have to run,” said Gandalf.   “But — ,” said Bilbo.   “No time for it,” said the wizard.   “But — ,” said Bilbo again.   “No time for that either! Off you go!”   To the end of his days Bilbo could never  remember how he found himself outside,  without a hat, a walking-stick or any money, or  anything that he usually took when he went out;  leaving his second breakfast half-finished and  quite unwashed-up, pushing his keys into  Gandalf s hands, and running as fast as his furry  feet could carry him down the lane, past the  great Mill, across The Water, and then on for a  mile or more.   Very puffed he was, when he got to Bywater  just on the stroke of eleven, and found he had  come without a pocket-handkerchief!   “Bravo!” said Balin who was standing at the  inn door looking out for him.   Just then all the others came round the  corner of the road from the village. They were  on ponies, and each pony was slung about with  all kinds of baggages, packages, parcels, and  paraphernalia. There was a very small pony,  apparently for Bilbo.   “Up you two get, and off we go!” said  Thorin.   “I'm awfully sorry,” said Bilbo, “but I have     come without my hat, and I have left my pocket-  handkerchief behind, and I haven't got any  money. I didn't get your note until after 10.45 to  be precise.”   “Don't be precise,” said Dwalin, “and don't  worry! You will have to manage without pocket-  handkerchiefs, and a good many other things,  before you get to the journey’s end. As for a hat,   I have got a spare hood and cloak in my  luggage.”   That's how they all came to start, jogging off  from the inn one fine morning just before May,  on laden ponies; and Bilbo was wearing a dark-  green hood (a little weather-stained) and a  dark-green cloak borrowed from Dwalin. They  were too large for him, and he looked rather  comic. What his father Bungo would have  thought of him, I daren't think. His only comfort  was he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf, as he  had no beard.   They had not been riding very long, when up  came Gandalf very splendid on a white horse.  He had brought a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs,  and Bilbo's pipe and tobacco. So after that the  party went along very merrily, and they told  stories or sang songs as they rode forward all  day, except of course when they stopped for  meals. These didn't come quite as often as  Bilbo would have liked them, but still he began  to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.   At first they had passed through hobbit-  lands, a wide respectable country inhabited by  decent folk, with good roads, an inn or two, and  now and then a dwarf or a farmer ambling by on  business. Then they came to lands where     people spoke strangely, and sang songs Bilbo  had never heard before. Now they had gone on  far into the Lone-lands, where there were no  people left, no inns, and the roads grew steadily  worse. Not far ahead were dreary hills, rising  higher and higher, dark with trees. On some of  them were old castles with an evil look, as if  they had been built by wicked people.  Everything seemed gloomy, for the weather that  day had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it had been  as good as May can be, can be, even in merry  tales, but now it was cold and wet. In the Lone-  lands they had been obliged to camp when they  could, but at least it had been dry.   “To think it will soon be June!” grumbled  Bilbo, as he splashed along behind the others  in a very muddy track. It was after tea-time; it  was pouring with rain, and had been all day; his  hood was dripping into his eyes, his cloak was  full of water; the pony was tired and stumbled on  stones; the others were too grumpy to talk. “And  I'm sure the rain has got into the dry clothes and  into the food-bags,” thought Bilbo. “Bother  burgling and everything to do with it! I wish I was  at home in my nice hole by the fire, with the  kettle just beginning to sing!” It was not the last  time that he wished that!   Still the dwarves jogged on, never turning  round or taking any notice of the hobbit.  Somewhere behind the grey clouds the sun  must have gone down, for it began to get dark  as they went down into a deep valley with a river  at the bottom. Wind got up, and willows along  its banks bent and sighed. Fortunately the road  went over an ancient stone bridge, for the river,     swollen with the rains, came rushing down from  the hills and mountains in the north.   It was nearly night when they had crossed  over. The wind broke up the grey clouds, and a  wandering moon appeared above the hills  between the flying rags. Then they stopped, and  Thorin muttered something about supper, “and  where shall we get a dry patch to sleep on?”   Not until then did they notice that Gandalf  was missing. So far he had come all the way  with them, never saying if he was in the  adventure or merely keeping them company for  a while. He had eaten most, talked most, and  laughed most. But now he simply was not there  at all!    “Just when a wizard would have been most  useful, too,” groaned Dori and Nori (who shared  the hobbit's views about regular meals, plenty  and often).   They decided in the end that they would  have to camp where they were. They moved to  a clump of trees, and though it was drier under  them, the wind shook the rain off the leaves,  and the drip, drip, was most annoying. Also the  mischief seemed to have got into the fire.  Dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out  of almost anything, wind or no wind; but they  could not do it that night, not even Oin and  Gloin, who were specially good at it.   Then one of the ponies took fright at nothing  and bolted. He got into the river before they  could catch him; and before they could get him  out again, Fili and Kili were nearly drowned,     and all the baggage that he carried was  washed away off him. Of course it was mostly  food, and there was mighty little left for supper,  and less for breakfast.   There they all sat glum and wet and  muttering, while Oin and Gloin went on trying to  light the fire, and quarrelling about it. Bilbo was  sadly reflecting that adventures are not all pony-  rides in May-sunshine, when Balin, who was  always their look-out man, said: “There's a light  over there!” There was a hill some way off with  trees on it, pretty thick in parts. Out of the dark  mass of the trees they could now see a light  shining, a reddish comfortable-looking light, as  it might be a fire or torches twinkling.   When they had looked at it for some while,  they fell to arguing. Some said “no” and some  said “yes”. Some said they could but go and  see, and anything was better than little supper,  less breakfast, and wet clothes all the night.   Others said: “These parts are none too well  known, and are too near the mountains.  Travellers seldom come this way now. The old  maps are no use: things have changed for the  worse and the road is unguarded. They have  seldom even heard of the king round here, and  the less inquisitive you are as you go along, the  less trouble you are likely to find.” Some said:  “After all there are fourteen of us.” Others said:  “Where has Gandalf got to?” This remark was  repeated by everybody. Then the rain began to  pour down worse than ever, and Oin and Gloin  began to fight.   That settled it. “After all we have got a  burglar with us,” they said; and so they made     off, leading their ponies (with all due and proper  caution) in the direction of the light. They came  to the hill and were soon in the wood. Up the hill  they went; but there was no proper path to be  seen, such as might lead to a house or a farm;  and do what they could they made a deal of  rustling and crackling and creaking (and a good  deal of grumbling and drafting), as they went  through the trees in the pitch dark.   Suddenly the red light shone out very bright  through the tree-trunks not far ahead.   “Now it is the burglar’s turn,” they said,  meaning Bilbo. “You must go on and find out all  about that light, and what it is for, and if all is  perfectly safe and canny,” said Thorin to the  hobbit. “Now scuttle off, and come back quick, if  all is well. If not, come back if you can! If you  can't, hoot twice like a barn-owl and once like a  screech-owl, and we will do what we can.”   Off Bilbo had to go, before he could explain  that he could not hoot even once like any kind of  owl any more than fly like a bat. But at any rate  hobbits can move quietly in woods, absolutely  quietly. They take a pride in it, and Bilbo had  sniffed more than once at what he called “all this  dwarvish racket,” as they went along, though I  don’t suppose you or I would have noticed  anything at all on a windy night, not if the whole  cavalcade had passed two feet off. As for Bilbo  walking primly towards the red light, I don't  suppose even a weasel would have stirred a  whisker at it. So, naturally, he got right up to the  fire — for fire it was — without disturbing anyone.  And this is what he saw.   Three very large persons sitting round a     very large fire of beech-logs. They were  toasting mutton on long spits of wood, and  licking the gravy off their fingers. There was a  fine toothsome smell. Also there was a barrel of  good drink at hand, and they were drinking out  of jugs. But they were trolls. Obviously trolls.  Even Bilbo, in spite of his sheltered life, could  see that: from the great heavy faces of them,  and theirsize, and the shape oftheirlegs, not to  mention their language, which was not drawing-  room fashion at all, at all.   “Mutton yesterday, mutton today, and  blimey, if it don't look like mutton again  tomorrer,” said one of the trolls.   “Never a blinking bit of manflesh have we  had for long enough,” said a second. “What the  'ell William was a-thinkin' of to bring us into  these parts at all, beats me — and the drink  runnin' short, what's more,” he said jogging the  elbow of William, who was taking a pull at his   jug.   William choked. “Shut yer mouth!” he said  as soon as he could. “Yer can't expect folk to  stop here for ever just to be et by you and Bert.  You've et a village and a half between yer, since  we come down from the mountains. How much  more d'yer want? And time's been up our way  when yer'd have said ‘thank yer Bill’ for a nice  bit o’ fat valley mutton like what this is.” He took  a big bite off a sheep's leg he was roasting,  and wiped his lips on his sleeve.   Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that,  even those with only one head each. After  hearing all this Bilbo ought to have done  something at once. Either he should have gone     back quietly and warned his friends that there  were three fair-sized trolls at hand in a nasty  mood, quite likely to try roasted dwarf, or even  pony, for a change; or else he should have done  a bit of good quick burgling. A really first-class  and legendary burglar would at this point have  picked the trolls’ pockets — it is nearly always  worth while, if you can manage it — , pinched the  very mutton off the spits, purloined the beer, and  walked off without their noticing him. Others  more practical but with less professional pride  would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each  of them before they observed it. Then the night  could have been spent cheerily.   Bilbo knew it. He had read of a good many  things he had never seen or done. He was very  much alarmed, as well as disgusted; he wished  himself a hundred miles away, and yet — and yet  somehow he could not go straight back to  Thorin and Company emptyhanded. So he  stood and hesitated in the shadows. Of the  various burglarious proceedings he had heard  of picking the trolls' pockets seemed the least  difficult, so at last he crept behind a tree just  behind William.   Bert and Tom went off to the barrel. William  was having another drink. Then Bilbo plucked  up courage and put his little hand in William's  enormous pocket. There was a purse in it, as  big as a bag to Bilbo. “Ha!” thought he,  warming to his new work as he lifted it carefully  out, “this is a beginning!”   It was! Trolls' purses are the mischief, and  this was no exception. “’Ere, 'oo are you?” it  squeaked, as it left the pocket; and William     turned round at once and grabbed Bilbo by the  neck, before he could duck behind the tree.   “Blimey, Bert, look what I’ve copped!” said  William.   “What is it?” said the others coming up.   “Lumme, if I knows! What are yer?”   “Bilbo Baggins, a bur — a hobbit,” said poor  Bilbo, shaking all over, and wondering how to  make owl-noises before they throttled him.   “A burrahobbit?” said they a bit startled.  Trolls are slow in the uptake, and mighty  suspicious about anything new to them.   “What's a burrahobbit got to do with my  pocket, anyways?” said William.   “And can yer cook 'em?” said Tom.   “Yer can try," said Bert, picking up a  skewer.   “He wouldn't make above a mouthful,” said  William, who had already had a fine supper,  “not when he was skinned and boned.”   “P'raps there are more like him round  about, and we might make a pie,” said Bert.  “Here you, are there any more of your sort a-  sneakin' in these here woods, yer nassty little  rabbit,” said he looking at the hobbit's furry feet;  and he picked him up by the toes and shook  him.   “Yes, lots,” said Bilbo, before he  remembered not to give his friends away. “No  none at all, not one,” he said immediately  afterwards.   “What d'yer mean?” said Bert, holding him  right way up, bythe hairthis time.   “What I say,” said Bilbo gasping. “And  please don't cook me, kind sirs! I am a good     cook myself, and cook better than I cook, if you  see what I mean. I’ll cook beautifully for you, a  perfectly beautiful breakfast for you, if only you  won't have me for supper.”   “Poor little blighter,” said William. He had  already had as much supper as he could hold;  also he had had lots of beer. “Poor little  blighter! Let him go!”   “Not till he says what he means by lots and  none at all," said Bert. “I don't want to have me  throat cut in me sleep! Hold his toes in the fire,  till he talks!”   “I won’t have it,” said William. “I caught him  anyway.”   “You're a fat fool, William,” said Bert, “as  I've said afore this evening.”   “And you're a lout!”   “And I won't take that from you, Bill  Huggins,” says Bert, and puts his fist in  William's eye.   Then there was a gorgeous row. Bilbo had  just enough wits left, when Bert dropped him on  the ground, to scramble out of the way of their  feet, before they were fighting like dogs, and  calling one another all sorts of perfectly true and  applicable names in very loud voices. Soon  they were locked in one another’s arms, and  rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping,  while Tom whacked at them both with a branch  to bring them to their senses — and that of  course only made them madder than ever.   That would have been the time for Bilbo to  have left. But his poor little feet had been very  squashed in Bert's big paw, and he had no  breath in his body, and his head was going     round; so there he lay for a while panting, just  outside the circle of firelight.   Right in the middle of the fight up came  Balin. The dwarves had heard noises from a  distance, and after waiting for some time for  Bilbo to come back, or to hoot like an owl, they  started off one by one to creep towards the light  as quietly as they could. No sooner did Tom  see Balin come into the light than he gave an  awful howl. Trolls simply detest the very sight of  dwarves (uncooked). Bert and Bill stopped  fighting immediately, and “a sack, Tom, quick!”  they said. Before Balin, who was wondering  where in all this commotion Bilbo was, knew  what was happening, a sack was over his head,  and he was down.   “There's more to come yet,” said Tom, “or  I'm mighty mistook. Lots and none at all, it is,”  said he. “No burrahobbits, but lots of these here  dwarves. That's about the shape of it!”   “I reckon you’re right,” said Bert, “and we’d  best get out of the light.”   And so they did. With sacks in their hands,  that they used for carrying off mutton and other  plunder, they waited in the shadows. As each  dwarf came up and looked at the fire, and the  spilled jugs, and the gnawed mutton, in  surprise, pop! went a nasty smelly sack over his  head, and he was down. Soon Dwalin lay by  Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and  Nori and Ori all in a heap, and Oin and Gloin  and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled  uncomfortably near the fire.   “That’ll teach 'em,” said Tom; for Bifur and  Bombur had given a lot of trouble, and fought     [ike mad, as dwarves will when cornered.   Thorin came last — and he was not caught  unawares. He came expecting mischief, and  didn't need to see his friends' legs sticking out  of sacks to tell him that things were not all well.  He stood outside in the shadows some way off,  and said: “What's all this trouble? Who has  been knocking my people about?”   “It's trolls!” said Bilbo from behind a tree.  They had forgotten all about him. “They’re  hiding in the bushes with sacks,” said he.   “O! are they?” said Thorin, and he jumped  forward to the fire, before they could leap on  him. He caught up a big branch all on fire at one  end: and Bert got that end in his eye before he  could step aside. That put him out of the battle  for a bit. Bilbo did his best. He caught hold of  Tom’s leg — as well as he could, it was thick as  a young tree-trunk — but he was sent spinning  up into the top of some bushes, when Tom  kicked the sparks up in Thorin's face.      The Trolls      Tom got the branch in his teeth for that, and  lost one of the front ones. It made him howl, I  can tell you. But just at that moment William  came up behind and popped a sack right over  Thorin's head and down to his toes. And so the  fight ended. A nice pickle they were all in now:  all neatly tied up in sacks, with three angry trolls  (and two with burns and bashes to remember)  sitting by them, arguing whether they should  roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil  them, or just sit on them one by one and squash  them into jelly; and Bilbo up in a bush, with his  clothes and his skin torn, not daring to move for  fear they should hear him.    It was just then that Gandalf came back. But no  one saw him. The trolls had just decided to  roast the dwarves now and eat them later — that  was Bert's idea, and after a lot of argument they  had all agreed to it.   “No good roasting 'em now, it'd take all  night,” said a voice. Bert thought it was  William's.   “Don't start the argument all over again,  Bill,” he said, “or it wll take all night.”   “Who's a-arguing?” said William, who  thought it was Bert that had spoken.   “You are,” said Bert.   “You’re a liar,” said William; and so the  argument began all over again. In the end they  decided to mince them fine and boil them. So  they got a great black pot, and they took out  their knives.   “No good boiling 'em! We ain't got no     water, and it's a long way to the well and all,”  said a voice. Bert and William thought it was  Tom’s.   “Shut up!” said they, “or we'll never have  done. And yer can fetch the water yerself, if yer  say any more.”   “Shut up yerself!” said Tom, who thought it  was William's voice. “Who’s arguing but you, I’d  like to know.”   “You’re a booby,” said William.   “Booby yerself!” said Tom.   And so the argument began all over again,  and went on hotter than ever, until at last they  decided to sit on the sacks one by one and  squash them, and boil them next time.   “Who shall we sit on first?” said the voice.   “Better sit on the last fellow first,” said Bert,  whose eye had been damaged by Thorin. He  thought Tom was talking.   “Don't talk to yerself!” said Tom. “But if you  wants to sit on the last one, sit on him. Which is  he?”   “The one with the yellow stockings," said  Bert.   “Nonsense, the one with the grey  stockings,” said a voice like William's.   “I made sure it was yellow,” said Bert.   “Yellow it was,” said William.   “Then what did yer say it was grey for?”  said Bert.   “I never did. Tom said it.”   “That I never did!” said Tom. “It was you.”   “Two to one, so shut yer mouth!” said Bert.   “Who are you a-talkin' to?” said William.   “Now stop it!” said Tom and Bert together.     “The night's gettin’ on, and dawn comes early.  Let's get on with it!”   “Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!”  said a voice that sounded like William’s. But it  wasn't. For just at that moment the light came  over the hill, and there was a mighty twitter in  the branches. William never spoke for he stood  turned to stone as he stooped; and Bert and  Tom were stuck like rocks as they looked at  him. And there they stand to this day, all alone,  unless the birds perch on them; for trolls, as you  probably know, must be underground before  dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the  mountains they are made of, and never move  again. That is what had happened to Bert and  Tom and William.   “Excellent!” said Gandalf, as he stepped  from behind a tree, and helped Bilbo to climb  down out of a thorn-bush. Then Bilbo  understood. It was the wizard's voice that had  kept the trolls bickering and quarrelling, until the  light came and made an end of them.   The next thing was to untie the sacks and let  out the dwarves. They were nearly suffocated,  and very annoyed: they had not at all enjoyed  lying there listening to the trolls making plans for  roasting them and squashing them and mincing  them. They had to hear Bilbo's account of what  had happened to him twice over, before they  were satisfied.   “Silly time to go practising pinching and  pocket-picking,” said Bombur, “when what we  wanted was fire and food!”   “And that’s just what you wouldn't have got  of those fellows without a struggle, in any case,”     said Gandalf. “Anyhow you are wasting time  now. Don't you realize that the trolls must have a  cave or a hole dug somewhere near to hide  from the sun in? We must look into it!”   They searched about, and soon found the  marks of trolls' stony boots going away through  the trees. They followed the tracks up the hill,  until hidden by bushes they came on a big door  of stone leading to a cave. But they could not  open it, not though they all pushed while  Gandalf tried various incantations.   “Would this be any good?” asked Bilbo,  when they were getting tired and angry. “I found  it on the ground where the trolls had their fight.”  He held out a largish key, though no doubt  William had thought it very small and secret. It  must have fallen out of his pocket, very luckily,  before he was turned to stone.   “Why on earth didn't you mention it before?”  they cried. Gandalf grabbed it and fitted it into  the keyhole. Then the stone door swung back  with one big push, and they all went inside.  There were bones on the floor and a nasty smell  was in the air; but there was a good deal of  food jumbled carelessly on shelves and on the  ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of all  sorts from brass buttons to pots full of gold  coins standing in a corner. There were lots of  clothes, too, hanging on the walls — too small for  trolls, I am afraid they belonged to victims — and  among them were several swords of various  makes, shapes, and sizes. Two caught their  eyes particularly, because of their beautiful  scabbards and jewelled hilts.   Gandalf and Thorin each took one of these;     and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. It  would have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a  troll, but it was as good as a short sword for the  hobbit.   “These look like good blades,” said the  wizard, half drawing them and looking at them  curiously. “They were not made by any troll, nor  by any smith among men in these parts and  days; but when we can read the runes on them,  we shall know more about them.”   “Let's get out of this horrible smell!” said  Fili. So they carried out the pots of coins, and  such food as was untouched and looked fit to  eat, also one barrel of ale which was still full. By  that time they felt like breakfast, and being very  hungry they did not turn their noses up at what  they had got from the trolls’ larder. Their own  provisions were very scanty. Now they had  bread and cheese, and plenty of ale, and bacon  to toast in the embers of the fire.   After that they slept, for their night had been  disturbed; and they did nothing more till the  afternoon. Then they brought up their ponies,  and carried away the pots of gold, and buried  them very secretly not far from the track by the  river, putting a great many spells over them, just  in case they ever had the chance to come back  and recover them. When that was done, they all  mounted once more, and jogged along again  on the path towards the East.   “Where did you go to, if I may ask?” said  Thorin to Gandalf as they rode along.   “To look ahead,” said he.   “And what brought you back in the nick of  time?”     “Looking behind,” said he.   “Exactly!” said Thorin; “but could you be  more plain?”   “I went on to spy out our road. It will soon  become dangerous and difficult. Also I was  anxious about replenishing our small stock of  provisions. I had not gone very far, however,  when I met a couple of friends of mine from  Rivendell.”   “Where's that?” asked Bilbo.   “Don't interrupt!” said Gandalf. “You will get  there in a few days now, if we’re lucky, and find  out all about it. As I was saying I met two of  Elrond's people. They were hurrying along for  fear of the trolls. It was they who told me that  three of them had come down from the  mountains and settled in the woods not far from  the road: they had frightened everyone away  from the district, and they waylaid strangers.   “I immediately had a feeling that I was  wanted back. Looking behind I saw a fire in the  distance and made for it. So now you know.  Please be more careful, next time, or we shall  never get anywhere!”   “Thank you!” said Thorin.      
Chapter III    A SHORT REST    They did not sing or tell stories that day, even  though the weather improved; nor the next day,  nor the day after. They had begun to feel that  danger was not far away on either side. They  camped under the stars, and their horses had  more to eat than they had; for there was plenty  of grass, but there was not much in their bags,  even with what they had got from the trolls. One  morning they forded a river at a wide shallow  place full of the noise of stones and foam. The  far bank was steep and slippery. When they got  to the top of it, leading their ponies, they saw  that the great mountains had marched down  very near to them. Already they seemed only a  day’s easy journey from the feet of the nearest.  Dark and drear it looked, though there were  patches of sunlight on its brown sides, and  behind its shoulders the tips of snow-peaks  gleamed.    “Is that The Mountain?” asked Bilbo in a  solemn voice, looking at it with round eyes. He  had never seen a thing that looked so big  before.   “Of course not!” said Balin. “That is only the  beginning of the Misty Mountains, and we have  got to get through, or over, or under those  somehow, before we can come into Wilderland  beyond. And it is a deal of a way even from the  other side of them to the Lonely Mountain in the  East where Smaug lies on our treasure.”   “O!” said Bilbo, and just at that moment he  felt more tired than he ever remembered feeling  before. He was thinking once again of his  comfortable chair before the fire in his favourite  sitting-room in his hobbit-hole, and of the kettle  singing. Not for the last time!    Now Gandalf led the way. “We must not miss  the road, or we shall be done for,” he said. “We  need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable  safety — also it is very necessary to tackle the  Misty Mountains by the proper path, or else you  will get lost in them, and have to come back and  start at the beginning again (if you ever get  back at all).”   They asked him where he was making for,     and he answered: “You are come to the very  edge of the Wild, as some of you may know.  Hidden somewhere ahead of us is the fair  valley of Rivendell where Elrond lives in the Last  Homely House. I sent a message by my friends,  and we are expected.”   That sounded nice and comforting, but they  had not got there yet, and it was not so easy as  it sounds to find the Last Homely House west of  the Mountains. There seemed to be no trees  and no valleys and no hills to break the ground  in front of them, only one vast slope going slowly  up and up to meet the feet of the nearest  mountain, a wide land the colour of heather and  crumbling rock, with patches and slashes of  grass-green and moss-green showing where  water might be.   Morning passed, afternoon came; but in all  the silent waste there was no sign of any  dwelling. They were growing anxious, for they  saw now that the house might be hidden almost  anywhere between them and the mountains.  They came on unexpected valleys, narrow with  steep sides, that opened suddenly at their feet,  and they looked down surprised to see trees  below them and running water at the bottom.  There were gullies that they could almost leap  over, but very deep with waterfalls in them.  There were dark ravines that one could neither     jump over nor climb into. There were bogs,  some of them green pleasant places to look at,  with flowers growing bright and tall; but a pony  that walked there with a pack on its back would  never have come out again.   It was indeed a much wider land from the  ford to the mountains than ever you would have  guessed. Bilbo was astonished. The only path  was marked with white stones, some of which  were small, and others were half covered with  moss or heather. Altogether it was a very slow  business following the track, even guided by  Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about  pretty well.   His head and beard wagged this way and  that as he looked for the stones, and they  followed his lead, but they seemed no nearer to  the end of the search when the day began to  fail. Tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed  supper-time would soon do the same. There  were moths fluttering about, and the light  became very dim, for the moon had not risen.  Bilbo’s pony began to stumble over roots and  stones. They came to the edge of a steep fall in  the ground so suddenly that Gandalfs horse  nearly slipped down the slope.   “Here it is at last!” he called, and the others  gathered round him and looked over the edge.  They saw a valley far below. They could hear     the voice of hurrying water in a rocky bed at the  bottom; the scent of trees was in the air; and  there was a light on the valley-side across the  water.   Bilbo never forgot the way they slithered  and slipped in the dusk down the steep zig-zag  path into the secret valley of Rivendell. The air  grew warmer as they got lower, and the smell of  the pine-trees made him drowsy, so that every  now and again he nodded and nearly fell off, or  bumped his nose on the pony’s neck. Their  spirits rose as they went down and down. The  trees changed to beech and oak, and there was  a comfortable feeling in the twilight. The last  green had almost faded out of the grass, when  they came at length to an open glade not far  above the banks of the stream.   “Hmmm! it smells like elves!” thought Bilbo,  and he looked up at the stars. They were  burning bright and blue. Just then there came a  burst of song like laughter in the trees:    O! What are you doing,   And where are you going?  Your ponies need shoeing!  The river is flowing!   O! tra-la-la-lally  here down in the valley!     O! What are you seeking,  And where are you making?  The faggots are reeking,   The bannocks are baking!  0! tril-lil-lil-lolly  the valley is jolly,  ha! ha!    0! Where are you going  With beards all a-wagging?  No knowing, no knowing  What brings Mister Baggins  And Balin and Dwalin  down into the valley  in June  ha! ha!    0! Will you be staying,   Or will you be flying?  Your ponies are straying!  The daylight is dying!     To fly would be folly,   To stay would be jolly  And listen and hark  Till the end of the dark  to our tune  ha! ha!    So they laughed and sang in the trees; and  pretty fair nonsense I daresay you think it. Not  that they would care; they would only laugh all  the more if you told them so. They were elves of  course. Soon Bilbo caught glimpses of them as  the darkness deepened. He loved elves, though  he seldom met them; but he was a little  frightened of them too. Dwarves don’t get on  well with them. Even decent enough dwarves  like Thorin and his friends think them foolish  (which is a very foolish thing to think), or get  annoyed with them. For some elves tease them  and laugh at them, and most of all at their  beards.   “Well, well!” said a voice. “Just look! Bilbo  the hobbit on a pony, my dear! Isn’t it delicious!”   “Most astonishing wonderful!”   Then off they went into another song as  ridiculous as the one I have written down in full.  At last one, a tall young fellow, came out from  the trees and bowed to Gandalf and to Thorin.     “Welcome to the valley!” he said.   “Thank you!” said Thorin a bit gruffly; but  Gandalf was already off his horse and among  the elves, talking merrily with them.   “You are a little out of your way,” said the elf:  “that is, if you are making for the only path  across the water and to the house beyond. We  will set you right, but you had best get on foot,  until you are over the bridge. Are you going to  stay a bit and sing with us, or will you go straight  on? Supper is preparing over there,” he said. “I  can smell the wood-fires for the cooking.”   Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to  stay a while. Elvish singing is not a thing to  miss, in June under the stars, not if you care for  such things. Also he would have liked to have a  few private words with these people that  seemed to know his names and all about him,  although he had never seen them before. He  thought their opinion of his adventure might be  interesting. Elves know a lot and are wondrous  folk for news, and know what is going on among  the peoples of the land, as quick as water flows,  or quicker.   But the dwarves were all for supper as soon  as possible just then, and would not stay. On  they all went, leading their ponies, till they were  brought to a good path and so at last to the very  brink of the river. It was flowing fast and noisily,     as mountain-streams do of a summer evening,  when sun has been all day on the snow far up  above. There was only a narrow bridge of stone  without a parapet, as narrow as a pony could  well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow  and careful, one by one, each leading his pony  by the bridle. The elves had brought bright  lanterns to the shore, and they sang a merry  song as the party went across.   “Don’t dip your beard in the foam, father!”  they cried to Thorin, who was bent almost on to  his hands and knees. “It is long enough without  watering it.”   “Mind Bilbo doesn’t eat all the cakes!” they  called. "He is too fat to get through key-holes  yet!”   “Hush, hush! Good People! and good  night!” said Gandalf, who came last. “Valleys  have ears, and some elves have over merry  tongues. Good night!”   And so at last they all came to the Last  Homely House, and found its doors flung wide.    Now it is a strange thing, but things that are  good to have and days that are good to spend  are soon told about, and not much to listen to;  while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating,     and even gruesome, may make a good tale,  and take a deal of telling anyway. They stayed  long in that good house, fourteen days at least,  and they found it hard to leave. Bilbo would  gladly have stopped there for ever and ever —  even supposing a wish would have taken him  right back to his hobbit-hole without trouble. Yet  there is little to tell about their stay.   The master of the house was an elf-friend —  one of those people whose fathers came into  the strange stories before the beginning of  History, the wars of the evil goblins and the  elves and the first men in the North. In those  days of our tale there were still some people  who had both elves and heroes of the North for  ancestors, and Elrond the master of the house  was their chief.   He was as noble and as fair in face as an  elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a  wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and  as kind as summer. He comes into many tales,  but his part in the story of Bilbo’s great  adventure is only a small one, though important,  as you will see, if we ever get to the end of it.  His house was perfect, whether you liked food,  or sleep, or work, or story-telling, or singing, or  just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant  mixture of them all. Evil things did not come into  that valley.     I wish I had time to tell you even a few of the  tales or one or two of the songs that they heard  in that house. All of them, the ponies as well,  grew refreshed and strong in a few days there.  Their clothes were mended as well as their  bruises, their tempers and their hopes. Their  bags were filled with food and provisions light  to carry but strong to bring them over the  mountain passes. Their plans were improved  with the best advice. So the time came to  midsummer eve, and they were to go on again  with the early sun on midsummer morning.   Elrond knew all about runes of every kind.  That day he looked at the swords they had  brought from the trolls’ lair, and he said: “These  are not troll-make. They are old swords, very old  swords of the High Elves of the West, my kin.  They were made in Gondolin for the Goblin-  wars. They must have come from a dragon’s  hoard or goblin plunder, for dragons and  goblins destroyed that city many ages ago.  This, Thorin, the runes name Orcrist, the Goblin-  cleaver in the ancient tongue of Gondolin; it was  a famous blade. This, Gandalf, was Glamdring,  Foe-hammer that the king of Gondolin once  wore. Keep them well!”   “Whence did the trolls get them, I wonder?”  said Thorin looking at his sword with new  interest.     “I could not say,” said Elrond, “but one may  guess that your trolls had plundered other  plunderers, or come on the remnants of old  robberies in some hold in the mountains. I have  heard that there are still forgotten treasures of  old to be found in the deserted caverns of the  mines of Moria, since the dwarf and goblin  war.”   Thorin pondered these words. “I will keep  this sword in honour,” he said. “May it soon  cleave goblins once again!”   “A wish that is likely to be granted soon  enough in the mountains!” said Elrond. “But  show me now your map!”   He took it and gazed long at it, and he  shook his head; for if he did not altogether  approve of dwarves and their love of gold, he  hated dragons and their cruel wickedness, and  he grieved to remember the ruin of the town of  Dale and its merry bells, and the burned banks  of the bright River Running. The moon was  shining in a broad silver crescent. He held up  the map and the white light shone through it.  “What is this?” he said. “There are moon-letters  here, beside the plain runes which say ‘five feet  high the door and three may walk abreast.’”   “What are moon-letters?” asked the hobbit  full of excitement. He loved maps, as I have told  you before; and he also liked runes and letters     and cunning handwriting, though when he wrote  himself it was a bit thin and spidery.   “Moon-letters are rune-letters, but you  cannot see them,” said Elrond, “not when you  look straight at them. They can only be seen  when the moon shines behind them, and what is  more, with the more cunning sort it must be a  moon of the same shape and season as the  day when they were written. The dwarves  invented them and wrote them with silver pens,  as your friends could tell you. These must have  been written on a midsummer’s eve in a  crescent moon, a long while ago.”   “What do they say?” asked Gandalf and  Thorin together, a bit vexed perhaps that even  Elrond should have found this out first, though  really there had not been a chance before, and  there would not have been another until  goodness knows when.   “Stand by the grey stone when the thrush   knocks. ” read Elrond, “and the setting sun with  the last light of Durin’s Day will shine upon the  key-hole.”   “Durin, Durin!” said Thorin. “He was the  father of the fathers of the eldest race of  Dwarves, the Longbeards, and my first  ancestor: I am his heir.”   “Then what is Durin’s Day?” asked Elrond.   “The first day of the dwarves’ New Year,”    said Thorin, “is as all should know the first day  of the last moon of Autumn on the threshold of  Winter. We still call it Durin’s Day when the last  moon of Autumn and the sun are in the sky  together. But this will not help us much, I fear, for  it passes our skill in these days to guess when  such a time will come again.”   “That remains to be seen,” said Gandalf. “Is  there any more writing?”   "None to be seen by this moon,” said  Elrond, and he gave the map back to Thorin;  and then they went down to the water to see the  elves dance and sing upon the midsummer’s  eve.   The next morning was a midsummer’s  morning as fair and fresh as could be dreamed:  blue sky and never a cloud, and the sun dancing  on the water. Now they rode away amid songs  of farewell and good speed, with their hearts  ready for more adventure, and with a  knowledge of the road they must follow over the  Misty Mountains to the land beyond.      
Chapter IV    OVER HILL AND UNDER HILL    There were many paths that led up into those  mountains, and many passes over them. But  most of the paths were cheats and deceptions  and led nowhere or to bad ends; and most of  the passes were infested by evil things and  dreadful dangers. The dwarves and the hobbit,  helped by the wise advice of Elrond and the  knowledge and memory of Gandalf, took the  right road to the right pass.   Long days after they had climbed out of the  valley and left the Last Homely House miles  behind, they were still going up and up and up. It  was a hard path and a dangerous path, a  crooked way and a lonely and a long. Now they  could look back over the lands they had left, laid  out behind them far below. Far, far away in the  West, where things were blue and faint, Bilbo  knew there lay his own country of safe and  comfortable things, and his little hobbit-hole. He  shivered. It was getting bitter cold up here, and  the wind came shrill among the rocks. Boulders,  too, at times came galloping down the  mountain-sides, let loose by mid-day sun upon    the snow, and passed among them (which was  lucky), or over their heads (which was  alarming). The nights were comfortless and  chill, and they did not dare to sing or talk too  loud, for the echoes were uncanny, and the  silence seemed to dislike being broken —  except by the noise of water and the wail of  wind and the crack of stone.   “The summer is getting on down below,”  thought Bilbo, “and haymaking is going on and  picnics. They will be harvesting and  blackberrying, before we even begin to go  down the other side at this rate.” And the others  were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although  when they had said good-bye to Elrond in the  high hope of a midsummer morning, they had  spoken gaily of the passage of the mountains,  and of riding swift across the lands beyond.  They had thought of coming to the secret door  in the Lonely Mountain, perhaps that very next  last moon of Autumn — “and perhaps it will be  Durin’s Day” they had said. Only Gandalf had  shaken his head and said nothing. Dwarves  had not passed that way for many years, but  Gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger  had grown and thriven in the Wild, since the  dragons had driven men from the lands, and the  goblins had spread in secret after the battle of  the Mines of Moria. Even the good plans of  wise wizards like Gandalf and of good friends  like Elrond go astray sometimes when you are  off on dangerous adventures over the Edge of     the Wild; and Gandalf was a wise enough  wizard to know it.    He knew that something unexpected might  happen, and he hardly dared to hope that they  would pass without fearful adventure over those  great tall mountains with lonely peaks and  valleys where no king ruled. They did not. All  was well, until one day they met a thunderstorm  — more than a thunderstorm, a thunder-battle.  You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm  can be down in the land and in a river-valley;  especially at times when two great  thunderstorms meet and clash. More terrible  still are thunder and lightning in the mountains at  night, when storms come up from East and  West and make war. The lightning splinters on  the peaks, and rocks shiver, and great crashes  split the air and go rolling and tumbling into  every cave and hollow; and the darkness is  filled with overwhelming noise and sudden light.   Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything  of the kind. They were high up in a narrow  place, with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at  one side of them. There they were sheltering  under a hanging rock for the night, and he lay  beneath a blanket and shook from head to toe.  When he peeped out in the lightning-flashes, he  saw that across the valley the stone-giants were  out, and were hurling rocks at one another for a  game, and catching them, and tossing them     down into the darkness where they smashed  among the trees far below, or splintered into  little bits with a bang. Then came a wind and a  rain, and the wind whipped the rain and the hail  about in every direction, so that an overhanging  rock was no protection at all. Soon they were  getting drenched and their ponies were  standing with their heads down and their tails  between their legs, and some of them were  whinnying with fright. They could hear the giants  guffawing and shouting all over the  mountainsides.   “This won't do at all!” said Thorin. “If we  don’t get blown off, or drowned, or struck by  lightning, we shall be picked up by some giant  and kicked sky-high for a football.”      The Mountain-path    “Well, if you know of anywhere better, take  us there!” said Gandalf, who was feeling very  grumpy, and was far from happy about the  giants himself.   The end of their argument was that they  sent Fili and Kili to look for a better shelter.  They had very sharp eyes, and being the  youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years  they usually got these sort of jobs (when  everybody could see that it was absolutely no  use sending Bilbo). There is nothing like  looking, if you want to find something (or so  Thorin said to the young dwarves). You certainly  usually find something, if you look, but it is not  always quite the something you were after. So it  proved on this occasion.   Soon Fili and Kili came crawling back,  holding on to the rocks in the wind. “We have  found a dry cave,” they said, “not far round the  next corner; and ponies and all could get  inside.”   “Flave you thoroughly explored it?” said the  wizard, who knew that caves up in the  mountains were seldom unoccupied.   “Yes, yes!” they said, though everybody  knew they could not have been long about it;  they had come back too quick. “It isn't all that  big, and it does not go far back.”   That, of course, is the dangerous part about     caves: you don’t know how far they go back,  sometimes, or where a passage behind may  lead to, or what is waiting for you inside. But  now Fili and Kili’s news seemed good enough.  So they all got up and prepared to move. The  wind was howling and the thunder still growling,  and they had a business getting themselves  and their ponies along. Still it was not very far to  go, and before long they came to a big rock  standing out into the path. If you stepped  behind, you found a low arch in the side of the  mountain. There was just room to get the  ponies through with a squeeze, when they had  been unpacked and unsaddled. As they passed  under the arch, it was good to hear the wind  and the rain outside instead of all about them,  and to feel safe from the giants and their rocks.  But the wizard was taking no risks. He lit up his  wand — as he did that day in Bilbo’s dining-  room that seemed so long ago, if you  remember — , and by its light they explored the  cave from end to end.   It seemed quite a fair size, but not too large  and mysterious. It had a dry floor and some  comfortable nooks. At one end there was room  for the ponies; and there they stood (mighty  glad of the change) steaming, and champing in  their nosebags. Oin and Gloin wanted to light a  fire at the door to dry their clothes, but Gandalf  would not hear of it. So they spread out their  wet things on the floor, and got dry ones out of  their bundles; then they made their blankets     comfortable, got out their pipes and blew  smoke rings, which Gandalf turned into different  colours and set dancing up by the roof to  amuse them. They talked and talked, and forgot  about the storm, and discussed what each  would do with his share of the treasure (when  they got it, which at the moment did not seem  so impossible); and so they dropped off to  sleep one by one. And that was the last time  that they used the ponies, packages,  baggages, tools and paraphernalia that they  had brought with them.   It turned out a good thing that night that they  had brought little Bilbo with them, after all. For,  somehow, he could not go to sleep for a long  while; and when he did sleep, he had very nasty  dreams. He dreamed that a crack in the wall at  the back of the cave got bigger and bigger, and  opened wider and wider, and he was very  afraid but could not call out or do anything but  lie and look. Then he dreamed that the floor of  the cave was giving way, and he was slipping —  beginning to fall down, down, goodness knows  where to.   At that he woke up with a horrible start, and  found that part of his dream was true. A crack  had opened at the back of the cave, and was  already a wide passage. He was just in time to  see the last of the ponies’ tails disappearing  into it. Of course he gave a very loud yell, as  loud a yell as a hobbit can give, which is  surprising for their size.     Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great  ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you  could say rocks and blocks. There were six to  each dwarf, at least, and two even for Bilbo;  and they were all grabbed and carried through  the crack, before you could say tinder and flint.  But not Gandalf. Bilbo’s yell had done that much  good. It had wakened him up wide in a  splintered second, and when goblins came to  grab him, there was a terrific flash like lightning  in the cave, a smell like gunpowder, and several  of them fell dead.   The crack closed with a snap, and Bilbo  and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it!  Where was Gandalf? Of that neither they nor the  goblins had any idea, and the goblins did not  wait to find out. They seized Bilbo and the  dwarves and hurried them along. It was deep,  deep, dark, such as only goblins that have  taken to living in the heart of the mountains can  see through. The passages there were crossed  and tangled in all directions, but the goblins  knew their way, as well as you do to the nearest  post-office; and the way went down and down,  and it was most horribly stuffy. The goblins were  very rough, and pinched unmercifully, and  chuckled and laughed in their horrible stony  voices; and Bilbo was more unhappy even than  when the troll had picked him up by his toes. He  wished again and again for his nice bright  hobbit-hole. Not for the last time.   Now there came a glimmer of a red light     before them. The goblins began to sing, or  croak, keeping time with the flap of their flat feet  on the stone, and shaking their prisoners as  well.    Clap! Snap! the black crack!  Grip, grab! Pinch, nab!   And down down to Goblin-town  You go, my lad!    Clash, crash! Crush, smash!   Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs!  Pound, pound, far underground!   Ho, ho! my lad!    Swish, smack! Whip crack!   Batter and beat! Yammer and bleat!  Work, work! Nor dare to shirk,   While Goblins quaff, and Goblins laugh,  Round and round far underground  Below, my lad!    It sounded truly terrifying. The walls echoed  to the clap, snap! and the crush, smash\ and to  the ugly laughter of their ho, ho! my lad! The     general meaning of the song was only too plain;  for now the goblins took out whips and whipped  them with a s\nish, smack!, and set them  running as fast as they could in front of them;  and more than one of the dwarves were already  yammering and bleating like anything, when  they stumbled into a big cavern.   It was lit by a great red fire in the middle,  and by torches along the walls, and it was full of  goblins. They all laughed and stamped and  clapped their hands, when the dwarves (with  poor little Bilbo at the back and nearest to the  whips) came running in, while the goblin-drivers  whooped and cracked their whips behind. The  ponies were already there huddled in a corner;  and there were all the baggages and packages  lying broken open, and being rummaged by  goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by  goblins, and quarrelled over by goblins.   I am afraid that was the last they ever saw  of those excellent little ponies, including a jolly  sturdy little white fellow that Elrond had lent to  Gandalf, since his horse was not suitable for the  mountain-paths. For goblins eat horses and  ponies and donkeys (and other much more  dreadful things), and they are always hungry.  Just now however the prisoners were thinking  only of themselves. The goblins chained their  hands behind their backs and linked them all  together in a line, and dragged them to the far  end of the cavern with little Bilbo tugging at the  end of the row.     There in the shadows on a large flat stone  sat a tremendous goblin with a huge head, and  armed goblins were standing round him  carrying the axes and the bent swords that they  use. Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-  hearted. They make no beautiful things, but they  make many clever ones. They can tunnel and  mine as well as any but the most skilled  dwarves, when they take the trouble, though  they are usually untidy and dirty. Hammers,  axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and  also instruments of torture, they make very well,  or get other people to make to their design,  prisoners and slaves that have to work till they  die for want of air and light. It is not unlikely that  they invented some of the machines that have  since troubled the world, especially the  ingenious devices for killing large numbers of  people at once, for wheels and engines and  explosions always delighted them, and also not  working with their own hands more than they  could help; but in those days and those wild  parts they had not advanced (as it is called) so  far. They did not hate dwarves especially, no  more than they hated everybody and everything,  and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in  some parts wicked dwarves had even made  alliances with them. But they had a special  grudge against Thorin’s people, because of the  war which you have heard mentioned, but which  does not come into this tale; and anyway  goblins don't care who they catch, as long as it     is done smart and secret, and the prisoners are  not able to defend themselves.   “Who are these miserable persons?” said  the Great Goblin.   “Dwarves, and this!” said one of the drivers,  pulling at Bilbo’s chain so that he fell forward  onto his knees. “We found them sheltering in  our Front Porch.”   “What do you mean by it?” said the Great  Goblin turning to Thorin. “Up to no good, I'll  warrant! Spying on the private business of my  people, I guess! Thieves, I shouldn’t be  surprised to learn! Murderers and friends of  Elves, not unlikely! Come! What have you got to  say?”   “Thorin the dwarf at your service!” he  replied — it was merely a polite nothing. “Of the  things which you suspect and imagine we had  no idea at all. We sheltered from a storm in  what seemed a convenient cave and unused;  nothing was further from our thoughts than  inconveniencing goblins in any way whatever.”  That was true enough!   “Urn!” said the Great Goblin. “So you say!  Might I ask what you were doing up in the  mountains at all, and where you were coming  from, and where you were going to? In fact I  should like to know all about you. Not that it will  do you much good, Thorin Oakenshield, I know  too much about your folk already; but let’s have  the truth, or I will prepare something particularly  uncomfortable for you!”     “We were on a journey to visit our relatives,  our nephews and nieces, and first, second, and  third cousins, and the other descendants of our  grandfathers, who live on the East side of these  truly hospitable mountains,” said Thorin, not  quite knowing what to say all at once in a  moment, when obviously the exact truth would  not do at all.   “He is a liar, O truly tremendous one!” said  one of the drivers. “Several of our people were  struck by lightning in the cave, when we invited  these creatures to come below; and they are as  dead as stones. Also he has not explained  this!” He held out the sword which Thorin had  worn, the sword which came from the Trolls' lair.   The Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of  rage when he looked at it, and all his soldiers  gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and  stamped. They knew the sword at once. It had  killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when the  fair elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or  did battle before their walls. They had called it  Orcrist, Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it  simply Biter. They hated it and hated worse any  one that carried it.   “Murderers and elf-friends!” the Great  Goblin shouted. “Slash them! Beat them! Bite  them! Gnash them! Take them away to dark  holes full of snakes, and never let them see the  light again!” He was in such a rage that he  jumped off his seat and himself rushed at Thorin  with his mouth open.     Just at that moment all the lights in the  cavern went out, and the great fire went off  poof! into a tower of blue glowing smoke, right  up to the roof, that scattered piercing white  sparks all among the goblins.   The yells and yammering, croaking,  jibbering and jabbering; howls, growls and  curses; shrieking and skriking, that followed  were beyond description. Several hundred wild  cats and wolves being roasted slowly alive  together would not have compared with it. The  sparks were burning holes in the goblins, and  the smoke that now fell from the roof made the  air too thick for even their eyes to see through.  Soon they were falling over one another and  rolling in heaps on the floor, biting and kicking  and fighting as if they had all gone mad.   Suddenly a sword flashed in its own light.  Bilbo saw it go right through the Great Goblin  as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his  rage. He fell dead, and the goblin soldiers fled  before the sword shrieking into the darkness.   The sword went back into its sheath.  “Follow me quick!” said a voice fierce and  quiet; and before Bilbo understood what had  happened he was trotting along again, as fast  as he could trot, at the end of the line, down  more dark passages with the yells of the goblin-  hall growing fainter behind him. A pale light was  leading them on.   “Quicker, quicker!” said the voice. “The  torches will soon be relit.”     “Half a minute!” said Dori, who was at the  back next to Bilbo, and a decent fellow. He  made the hobbit scramble on his shoulders as  best he could with his tied hands, and then off  they all went at a run, with a clink-clink of chains,  and many a stumble, since they had no hands  to steady themselves with. Not for a long while  did they stop, and by that time they must have  been right down in the very mountain’s heart.   Then Gandalf lit up his wand. Of course it  was Gandalf; but just then they were too busy to  ask how he got there. He took out his sword  again, and again it flashed in the dark by itself.  It burned with a rage that made it gleam if  goblins were about; now it was bright as blue  flame for delight in the killing of the great lord of  the cave. It made no trouble whatever of cutting  through the goblin-chains and setting all the  prisoners free as quickly as possible. This  sword’s name was Glamdring the Foe-hammer,  if you remember. The goblins just called it  Beater, and hated it worse than Biter if  possible. Orcrist, too, had been saved; for  Gandalf had brought it along as well, snatching  it from one of the terrified guards. Gandalf  thought of most things; and though he could not  do everything, he could do a great deal for  friends in a tight corner.   “Are we all here?” said he, handing his  sword back to Thorin with a bow. “Let me see:  one — that's Thorin; two, three, four, five, six,  seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven; where are Fili     and Kili? Here they are! twelve, thirteen — and  here’s Mr. Baggins: fourteen! Well, well! it might  be worse, and then again it might be a good  deal better. No ponies, and no food, and no  knowing quite where we are, and hordes of  angry goblins just behind! On we go!”   On they went. Gandalf was quite right: they  began to hear goblin noises and horrible cries  far behind in the passages they had come  through. That sent them on faster than ever, and  as poor Bilbo could not possibly go half as fast  — for dwarves can roll along at a tremendous  pace, I can tell you, when they have to — they  took it in turn to carry him on their backs.   Still goblins go faster than dwarves, and  these goblins knew the way better (they had  made the paths themselves), and were madly  angry; so that do what they could the dwarves  heard the cries and howls getting closer and  closer. Soon they could hear even the flap of the  goblin feet, many many feet which seemed only  just round the last corner. The blink of red  torches could be seen behind them in the tunnel  they were following; and they were getting  deadly tired.   “Why, O why did I ever leave my hobbit-  hole!” said poor Mr. Baggins bumping up and  down on Bombur’s back.   “Why, O why did I ever bring a wretched  little hobbit on a treasure hunt!” said poor  Bombur, who was fat, and staggered along with  the sweat dripping down his nose in his heat     and terror.   At this point Gandalf fell behind, and Thorin  with him. They turned a sharp corner. “About  turn!” he shouted. “Draw your sword Thorin!”   There was nothing else to be done; and the  goblins did not like it. They came scurrying  round the corner in full cry, and found Goblin-  cleaver, and Foe-hammer shining cold and  bright right in their astonished eyes. The ones in  front dropped their torches and gave one yell  before they were killed. The ones behind yelled  still more, and leaped back knocking over those  that were running after them. “Biter and Beater!”  they shrieked; and soon they were all in  confusion, and most of them were hustling back  the way they had come.   It was quite a long while before any of them  dared to turn that corner. By that time the  dwarves had gone on again, a long, long, way  on into the dark tunnels of the goblins’ realm.  When the goblins discovered that, they put out  their torches and they slipped on soft shoes,  and they chose out their very quickest runners  with the sharpest ears and eyes. These ran  forward, as swift as weasels in the dark, and  with hardly any more noise than bats.   That is why neither Bilbo, nor the dwarves,  nor even Gandalf heard them coming. Nor did  they see them. But they were seen by the  goblins that ran silently up behind, for Gandalf  was letting his wand give out a faint light to help  the dwarves as they went along.     Quite suddenly Dori, now at the back again  carrying Bilbo, was grabbed from behind in the  dark. He shouted and fell; and the hobbit rolled  off his shoulders into the blackness, bumped  his head on hard rock, and remembered  nothing more.      
Chapter V    RIDDLES IN THE DARK    When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if  he had; for it was just as dark as with them shut.  No one was anywhere near him. Just imagine  his fright! He could hear nothing, see nothing,  and he could feel nothing except the stone of  the floor.   Very slowly he got up and groped about on  all fours, till he touched the wall of the tunnel; but  neither up nor down it could he find anything:  nothing at all, no sign of goblins, no sign of  dwarves. His head was swimming, and he was  far from certain even of the direction they had  been going in when he had his fall. He guessed  as well as he could, and crawled along for a  good way, till suddenly his hand met what felt  like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of  the tunnel. It was a turning point in his career,  but he did not know it. He put the ring in his  pocket almost without thinking; certainly it did    not seem of any particular use at the moment.  He did not go much further, but sat down on the  cold floor and gave himself up to complete  miserableness, for a long while. He thought of  himself frying bacon and eggs in his own  kitchen at home — for he could feel inside that it  was high time for some meal or other; but that  only made him miserabler.   He could not think what to do; nor could he  think what had happened; or why he had been  left behind; or why, if he had been left behind,  the goblins had not caught him; or even why his  head was so sore. The truth was he had been  lying quiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very  dark corner for a long while.   After some time he felt for his pipe. It was  not broken, and that was something. Then he  felt for his pouch, and there was some tobacco  in it, and that was something more. Then he felt  for matches and he could not find any at all, and  that shattered his hopes completely. Just as  well for him, as he agreed when he came to his  senses. Goodness knows what the striking of  matches and the smell of tobacco would have  brought on him out of dark holes in that horrible  place. Still at the moment he felt very crushed.  But in slapping all his pockets and feeling all  round himself for matches his hand came on the  hilt of his little sword — the little dagger that he     got from the trolls, and that he had quite  forgotten; nor fortunately had the goblins  noticed it, as he wore it inside his breeches.   Now he drew it out. It shone pale and dim  before his eyes. “So it is an elvish blade, too,”  he thought; “and goblins are not very near, and  yet not far enough.”   But somehow he was comforted. It was  rather splendid to be wearing a blade made in  Gondolin for the goblin-wars of which so many  songs had sung; and also he had noticed that  such weapons made a great impression on  goblins that came upon them suddenly.   “Go back?” he thought. “No good at all! Go  sideways? Impossible! Go forward? Only thing  to do! On we go!” So up he got, and trotted  along with his little sword held in front of him  and one hand feeling the wall, and his heart all  of a patter and a pitter.    Now certainly Bilbo was in what is called a tight  place. But you must remember it was not quite  so tight for him as it would have been for me or  for you. Hobbits are not quite like ordinary  people; and after all if their holes are nice  cheery places and properly aired, quite different  from the tunnels of the goblins, still they are     more used to tunnelling than we are, and they  do not easily lose their sense of direction  underground — not when their heads have  recovered from being bumped. Also they can  move very quietly, and hide easily, and recover  wonderfully from falls and bruises, and they  have a fund of wisdom and wise sayings that  men have mostly never heard or have forgotten  long ago.   I should not have liked to have been in Mr.  Baggins’ place, all the same. The tunnel  seemed to have no end. All he knew was that it  was still going down pretty steadily and keeping  in the same direction in spite of a twist and a  turn or two. There were passages leading off to  the side every now and then, as he knew by the  glimmer of his sword, or could feel with his hand  on the wall. Of these he took no notice, except  to hurry past for fear of goblins or half-imagined  dark things coming out of them. On and on he  went, and down and down; and still he heard no  sound of anything except the occasional whirr of  a bat by his ears, which startled him at first, till it  became too frequent to bother about. I do not  know how long he kept on like this, hating to go  on, not daring to stop, on, on, until he was  tireder than tired. It seemed like all the way to  tomorrow and over it to the days beyond.   Suddenly without any warning he trotted     splash into water! Ugh! it was icy cold. That  pulled him up sharp and short. He did not know  whether it was just a pool in the path, or the  edge of an underground stream that crossed  the passage, or the brink of a deep dark  subterranean lake. The sword was hardly  shining at all. He stopped, and he could hear,  when he listened hard, drops drip-drip-dripping  from an unseen roof into the water below; but  there seemed no other sort of sound.   “So it is a pool or a lake, and not an  underground river,” he thought. Still he did not  dare to wade out into the darkness. He could  not swim; and he thought, too, of nasty slimy  things, with big bulging blind eyes, wriggling in  the water. There are strange things living in the  pools and lakes in the hearts of mountains: fish  whose fathers swam in, goodness only knows  how many years ago, and never swam out  again, while their eyes grew bigger and bigger  and bigger from trying to see in the blackness;  also there are other things more slimy than fish.  Even in the tunnels and caves the goblins have  made for themselves there are other things  living unbeknown to them that have sneaked in  from outside to lie up in the dark. Some of  these caves, too, go back in their beginnings to  ages before the goblins, who only widened  them and joined them up with passages, and     the original owners are still there in odd  corners, slinking and nosing about.   Deep down here by the dark water lived old  Gollum, a small slimy creature. I don’t know  where he came from, nor who or what he was.  He was Gollum — as dark as darkness, except  for two big round pale eyes in his thin face. He  had a little boat, and he rowed about quite  quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and  deep and deadly cold. He paddled it with large  feet dangling over the side, but never a ripple  did he make. Not he. He was looking out of his  pale lamp-like eyes for blind fish, which he  grabbed with his long fingers as quick as  thinking. He liked meat too. Goblin he thought  good, when he could get it; but he took care  they never found him out. He just throttled them  from behind, if they ever came down alone  anywhere near the edge of the water, while he  was prowling about. They very seldom did, for  they had a feeling that something unpleasant  was lurking down there, down at the very roots  of the mountain. They had come on the lake,  when they were tunnelling down long ago, and  they found they could go no further; so there  their road ended in that direction, and there was  no reason to go that way — unless the Great  Goblin sent them. Sometimes he took a fancy  for fish from the lake, and sometimes neither     goblin nor fish came back.   Actually Gollum lived on a slimy island of  rock in the middle of the lake. He was watching  Bilbo now from the distance with his pale eyes  like telescopes. Bilbo could not see him, but he  was wondering a lot about Bilbo, for he could  see that he was no goblin at all.   Gollum got into his boat and shot off from  the island, while Bilbo was sitting on the brink  altogether flummoxed and at the end of his way  and his wits. Suddenly up came Gollum and  whispered and hissed:   “Bless us and splash us, my precioussss! I  guess it’s a choice feast; at least a tasty morsel  it’d make us, gollum!”And when he said gollum  he made a horrible swallowing noise in his  throat. That is how he got his name, though he  always called himself ‘my precious’.   The hobbit jumped nearly out of his skin  when the hiss came in his ears, and he  suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him.   “Who are you?” he said, thrusting his  dagger in front of him.   “What iss he, my preciouss?” whispered  Gollum (who always spoke to himself through  never having anyone else to speak to). This is  what he had come to find out, for he was not  really very hungry at the moment, only curious;  otherwise he would have grabbed first and     whispered afterwards.   “I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins. I have lost the  dwarves and I have lost the wizard, and I don’t  know where I am; and I don’t want to know, if  only I can get away.”   “What’s he got in his handses?” said  Gollum, looking at the sword, which he did not  quite like.   “A sword, a blade which came out of  Gondolin!”   “Sssss” said Gollum, and became quite  polite. “Praps ye sits here and chats with it a  bitsy, my preciousss. It likes riddles, praps it  does, does it?” He was anxious to appear  friendly, at any rate for the moment, and until he  found out more about the sword and the hobbit,  whether he was quite alone really, whether he  was good to eat, and whether Gollum was really  hungry. Riddles were all he could think of.  Asking them, and sometimes guessing them,  had been the only game he had ever played  with other funny creatures sitting in their holes in  the long, long ago, before he lost all his friends  and was driven away, alone, and crept down,  down, into the dark under the mountains.   “Very well,” said Bilbo, who was anxious to  agree, until he found out more about the  creature, whether he was quite alone, whether  he was fierce or hungry, and whether he was a     friend of the goblins.   “You ask first,” he said, because he had not  had time to think of a riddle.   So Gollum hissed:    What has roots as nobody sees,  Is taller than trees,   Up, up it goes,   And yet never grows?    “Easy!” said Bilbo. “Mountain, I suppose.”   “Does it guess easy? It must have a  competition with us, my preciouss! If precious  asks, and it doesn’t answer, we eats it, my  preciousss. If it asks us, and we doesn’t  answer, then we does what it wants, eh? We  shows it the way out, yes!”   “All right!” said Bilbo, not daring to  disagree, and nearly bursting his brain to think  of riddles that could save him from being eaten.    Thirty white horses on a red hill,  First they champ,   Then they stamp,   Then they stand still.     That was all he could think of to ask — the  idea of eating was rather on his mind. It was  rather an old one, too, and Gollum knew the  answer as well as you do.   “Chestnuts, chestnuts,” he hissed. “Teeth!  teeth! my preciousss; but we has only six!” Then  he asked his second:    Voiceless it cries,  Wingless flutters,  Toothless bites,  Mouthless mutters.    “Half a moment!” cried Bilbo, who was still  thinking uncomfortably about eating. Fortunately  he had once heard something rather like this  before, and getting his wits back he thought of  the answer. “Wind, wind of course,” he said,  and he was so pleased that he made up one on  the spot. “This’ll puzzle the nasty little  underground creature,” he thought:    An eye in a blue face  Sawan eye in a green face.  “That eye is like to this eye”  Said the first eye,     “Butin tow place  Notin high place.”    “Ss, ss, ss,” said Gollum. He had been  underground a long long time, and was  forgetting this sort of thing. But just as Bilbo was  beginning to hope that the wretch would not be  able to answer, Gollum brought up memories of  ages and ages and ages before, when he lived  with his grandmother in a hole in a bank by a  river, “Sss, sss, my preciouss,” he said. “Sun on  the daisies it means, it does.”   But these ordinary above ground everyday  sort of riddles were tiring for him. Also they  reminded him of days when he had been less  lonely and sneaky and nasty, and that put him  out of temper. What is more they made him  hungry; so this time he tried something a bit  more difficult and more unpleasant:    It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,  Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.  It lies behind stars and Underhills,  And empty holes it fills.   It comes first and follows after,  Ends life, kills laughter.     Unfortunately for Gollum Bilbo had heard  that sort of thing before; and the answer was all  round him anyway. “Dark!” he said without even  scratching his head or putting on his thinking  cap.    A box without hinges, key, or lid,  Yet golden treasure inside is hid,    he asked to gain time, until he could think of a  really hard one. This he thought a dreadfully  easy chestnut, though he had not asked it in the  usual words. But it proved a nasty poser for  Gollum. He hissed to himself, and still he did not  answer; he whispered and spluttered.   After some while Bilbo became impatient.  “Well, what is it?” he said. “The answer’s not a  kettle boiling over, as you seem to think from  the noise you are making.”   “Give us a chance; let it give us a chance,  my preciouss — ss — ss.”   “Well,” said Bilbo after giving him a long  chance, “what about your guess?”   But suddenly Gollum remembered thieving  from nests long ago, and sitting under the river     bank teaching his grandmother, teaching his  grandmother to suck — “Eggses!” he hissed.  “Eggses it is!” Then he asked:    Alive without breath,   As cold as death;   Never thirsty, ever drinking,  All in mail never clinking.    He also in his turn thought this was a  dreadfully easy one, because he was always  thinking of the answer. But he could not  remember anything better at the moment, he  was so flustered by the egg-question. All the  same it was a poser for poor Bilbo, who never  had anything to do with the water if he could  help it. I imagine you know the answer, of  course, or can guess it as easy as winking,  since you are sitting comfortably at home and  have not the danger of being eaten to disturb  your thinking. Bilbo sat and cleared his throat  once or twice, but no answer came.   After a while Gollum began to hiss with  pleasure to himself: “Is it nice, my preciousss?  Is it juicy? Is it scrumptiously crunchable?” He  began to peer at Bilbo out of the darkness.   “Half a moment,” said the hobbit shivering.     “I gave you a good long chance just now.”   “It must make haste, haste!” said Gollum,  beginning to climb out of his boat on to the  shore to get at Bilbo. But when he put his long  webby foot in the water, a fish jumped out in a  fright and fell on Bilbo’s toes.   “Ugh!” he said, “it is cold and clammy!” —  and so he guessed. “Fish! fish!” he cried. “It is  fish!”   Gollum was dreadfully disappointed; but  Bilbo asked another riddle as quick as ever he  could, so that Gollum had to get back into his  boat and think.   No-legs lay on one-leg, two-legs sat near  on three-legs, four-legs got some.   It was not really the right time for this riddle,  but Bilbo was in a hurry. Gollum might have had  some trouble guessing it, if he had asked it at  another time. As it was, talking offish, “no-legs”  was not so very difficult, and after that the rest  was easy. “Fish on a little table, man at table  sitting on a stool, the cat has the bones” that of  course is the answer, and Gollum soon gave it.  Then he thought the time had come to ask  something hard and horrible. This is what he  said:    This thing all things devours:     Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;  Gnaws iron, bites steel;   Grinds hard stones to meal;  Slays king, ruins town,   And beats high mountain down.    Poor Bilbo sat in the dark thinking of all the  horrible names of all the giants and ogres he  had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of  them had done all these things. He had a  feeling that the answer was quite different and  that he ought to know it, but he could not think of  it. He began to get frightened, and that is bad  for thinking. Gollum began to get out of his boat.  He flapped into the water and paddled to the  bank; Bilbo could see his eyes coming towards  him. His tongue seemed to stick in his mouth;  he wanted to shout out: “Give me more time!  Give me time!” But all that came out with a  sudden squeal was:   “Time! Time!”    Bilbo was saved by pure luck. For that of  course was the answer.   Gollum was disappointed once more; and  now he was getting angry, and also tired of the  game. It had made him very hungry indeed. This     time he did not go back to the boat. He sat  down in the dark by Bilbo. That made the hobbit  most dreadfully uncomfortable and scattered  his wits.   “It’s got to ask uss a quesstion, my  preciouss, yes, yess, yesss. Jusst one more  question to guess, yes, yess,” said Gollum.   But Bilbo simply could not think of any  question with that nasty wet cold thing sitting  next to him, and pawing and poking him. He  scratched himself, he pinched himself; still he  could not think of anything.   “Ask us! ask us!” said Gollum.   Bilbo pinched himself and slapped himself;  he gripped on his little sword; he even felt in his  pocket with his other hand. There he found the  ring he had picked up in the passage and  forgotten about.   “What have I got in my pocket?” he said  aloud. He was talking to himself, but Gollum  thought it was a riddle, and he was frightfully  upset.   "Not fair! not fair!” he hissed. “It isn’t fair, my  precious, is it, to ask us what it’s got in its  nassty little pocketses?”   Bilbo seeing what had happened and  having nothing better to ask stuck to his  question, “What have I got in my pocket?” he  said louder.     “S-s-s-s-s,” hissed Gollum. “It must give us  three guesseses, my preciouss, three  guesseses.”   “Very well! Guess away!” said Bilbo.   “Handses!” said Gollum.   “Wrong,” said Bilbo, who had luckily just  taken his hand out again. “Guess again!”   “S-s-s-s-s,” said Gollum more upset than  ever. He thought of all the things he kept in his  own pockets: fish-bones, goblins’ teeth, wet  shells, a bit of bat-wing, a sharp stone to  sharpen his fangs on, and other nasty things.  He tried to think what other people kept in their  pockets.   “Knife!” he said at last.   “Wrong!” said Bilbo, who had lost his some  time ago. “Last guess!”   Now Gollum was in a much worse state  than when Bilbo had asked him the egg-  question. He hissed and spluttered and rocked  himself backwards and forwards, and slapped  his feet on the floor, and wriggled and  squirmed; but still he did not dare to waste his  last guess.   “Come on!” said Bilbo. “I am waiting!” He  tried to sound bold and cheerful, but he did not  feel at all sure how the game was going to end,  whether Gollum guessed right or not.   “Time’s up!” he said.     “String, or nothing!” shrieked Gollum, which  was not quite fair — working in two guesses at  once.   “Both wrong,” cried Bilbo very much  relieved; and he jumped at once to his feet, put  his back to the nearest wall, and held out his  little sword. He knew, of course, that the riddle-  game was sacred and of immense antiquity,  and even wicked creatures were afraid to cheat  when they played at it. But he felt he could not  trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a  pinch. Any excuse would do for him to slide out  of it. And after all that last question had not  been a genuine riddle according to the ancient  laws.   But at any rate Gollum did not at once  attack him. He could see the sword in Bilbo’s  hand. He sat still, shivering and whispering. At  last Bilbo could wait no longer.   “Well?” he said. “What about your promise?  I want to go. You must show me the way.”   “Did we say so, precious? Show the nassty  little Baggins the way out, yes, yes. But what  has it got in its pocketses, eh? Not string,  precious, but not nothing. Oh no! gollum!”   "Never you mind,” said Bilbo. “A promise is  a promise.”   “Cross it is, impatient, precious,” hissed  Gollum. “But it must wait, yes it must. We can’t     go up the tunnels so hasty. We must go and get  some things first, yes, things to help us.”   “Well, hurry up!” said Bilbo, relieved to think  of Gollum going away. He thought he was just  making an excuse and did not mean to come  back. What was Gollum talking about? What  useful thing could he keep out on the dark lake?  But he was wrong. Gollum did mean to come  back. He was angry now and hungry. And he  was a miserable wicked creature, and already  he had a plan.   Not far away was his island, of which Bilbo  knew nothing, and there in his hiding-place he  kept a few wretched oddments, and one very  beautiful thing, very beautiful, very wonderful. He  had a ring, a golden ring, a precious ring.   “My birthday-present!” he whispered to  himself, as he had often done in the endless  dark days. “That’s what we wants now, yes; we  wants it!”   He wanted it because it was a ring of  power, and if you slipped that ring on your  finger, you were invisible; only in the full sunlight  could you be seen, and then only by your  shadow, and that would be shaky and faint.   “My birthday-present! It came to me on my  birthday, my precious.” So he had always said  to himself. But who knows how Gollum came by  that present, ages ago in the old days when     such rings were still at large in the world?  Perhaps even the Master who ruled them could  not have said. Gollum used to wear it at first, till  it tired him; and then he kept it in a pouch next  his skin, till it galled him; and now usually he hid  it in a hole in the rock on his island, and was  always going back to look at it. And still  sometimes he put it on, when he could not bear  to be parted from it any longer, or when he was  very, very, hungry, and tired of fish. Then he  would creep along dark passages looking for  stray goblins. He might even venture into places  where the torches were lit and made his eyes  blink and smart; for he would be safe. Oh yes,  quite safe. No one would see him, no one would  notice him, till he had his fingers on their throat.  Only a few hours ago he had worn it, and caught  a small goblin-imp. How it squeaked! He still  had a bone or two left to gnaw, but he wanted  something softer.   “Quite safe, yes,” he whispered to himself.  “It won’t see us, will it, my precious? No. It won’t  see us, and its nassty little sword will be  useless, yes quite.”   That is what was in his wicked little mind, as  he slipped suddenly from Bilbo’s side, and  flapped back to his boat, and went off into the  dark. Bilbo thought he had heard the last of him.  Still he waited a while; for he had no idea how     to find his way out alone.   Suddenly he heard a screech. It sent a  shiver down his back. Gollum was cursing and  wailing away in the gloom, not very far off by the  sound of it. He was on his island, scrabbling  here and there, searching and seeking in vain.   “Where iss it? Where iss it?” Bilbo heard  him crying. “Losst it is, my precious, lost, lost!  Curse us and crush us, my precious is lost!”   “What’s the matter?” Bilbo called. “What  have you lost?”   “It mustn’t ask us,” shrieked Gollum. "Not its  business, no, gollum! It’s losst, gollum, gollum,  gollum.”   “Well, so am I,” cried Bilbo, “and I want to  get unlost. And I won the game, and you  promised. So come along! Come and let me  out, and then go on with your looking!” Utterly  miserable as Gollum sounded, Bilbo could not  find much pity in his heart, and he had a feeling  that anything Gollum wanted so much could  hardly be something good. “Come along!” he  shouted.   “No, not yet, precious!” Gollum answered.  “We must search for it, it’s lost, gollum.”   “But you never guessed my last question,  and you promised,” said Bilbo.   "Never guessed!” said Gollum. Then  suddenly out of the gloom came a sharp hiss.     “What has it got in its pocketses? Tell us that. It  must tell first.”   As far as Bilbo knew, there was no  particular reason why he should not tell.  Gollum’s mind had jumped to a guess quicker  than his; naturally, for Gollum had brooded for  ages on this one thing, and he was always  afraid of its being stolen. But Bilbo was  annoyed at the delay. After all, he had won the  game, pretty fairly, at a horrible risk. “Answers  were to be guessed not given,” he said.   “But it wasn’t a fair question,” said Gollum.  “Not a riddle, precious, no.”   “Oh well, if it’s a matter of ordinary  questions,” Bilbo replied, “then I asked one first.  What have you lost? Tell me that!”   “What has it got in its pocketses?” The  sound came hissing louder and sharper, and as  he looked towards it, to his alarm Bilbo now  saw two small points of light peering at him. As  suspicion grew in Gollum’s mind, the light of his  eyes burned with a pale flame.   “What have you lost?” Bilbo persisted.   But now the light in Gollum’s eyes had  become a green fire, and it was coming swiftly  nearer. Gollum was in his boat again, paddling  wildly back to the dark shore; and such a rage  of loss and suspicion was in his heart that no  sword had any more terror for him.     Bilbo could not guess what had maddened  the wretched creature, but he saw that all was  up, and that Gollum meant to murder him at any  rate. Just in time he turned and ran blindly back  up the dark passage down which he had come,  keeping close to the wall and feeling it with his  left hand.   “What has it got in its pocketses?” he heard  the hiss loud behind him, and the splash as  Gollum leapt from his boat. “What have I, I  wonder?” he said to himself, as he panted and  stumbled along. He put his left hand in his  pocket. The ring felt very cold as it quietly  slipped on to his groping forefinger.   The hiss was close behind him. He turned  now and saw Gollum’s eyes like small green  lamps coming up the slope. Terrified he tried to  run faster, but suddenly he struck his toes on a  snag in the floor, and fell flat with his little sword  under him.   In a moment Gollum was on him. But before  Bilbo could do anything, recover his breath,  pick himself up, or wave his sword, Gollum  passed by, taking no notice of him, cursing and  whispering as he ran.   What could it mean? Gollum could see in  the dark. Bilbo could see the light of his eyes  palely shining even from behind. Painfully he got  up, and sheathed his sword, which was now     glowing faintly again, then very cautiously he  followed. There seemed nothing else to do. It  was no good crawling back down to Gollum’s  water. Perhaps if he followed him, Gollum might  lead him to some way of escape without  meaning to.   “Curse it! curse it! curse it!” hissed Gollum.  “Curse the Baggins! It’s gone! What has it got  in its pocketses? Oh we guess, we guess, my  precious. He’s found it, yes he must have. My  birthday-present.”   Bilbo pricked up his ears. He was at last  beginning to guess himself. He hurried a little,  getting as close as he dared behind Gollum,  who was still going quickly, not looking back,  but turning his head from side to side, as Bilbo  could see from the faint glimmer on the walls.   “My birthday-present! Curse it! How did we  lose it, my precious? Yes, that’s it. When we  came this way last, when we twisted that nassty  young squeaker. That’s it. Curse it! It slipped  from us, after all these ages and ages! It’s  gone, gollum."   Suddenly Gollum sat down and began to  weep, a whistling and gurgling sound horrible to  listen to. Bilbo halted and flattened himself  against the tunnel-wall. After a while Gollum  stopped weeping and began to talk. He  seemed to be having an argument with himself.     “It’s no good going back there to search,  no. We doesn’t remember all the places we’ve  visited. And it’s no use. The Baggins has got it  in its pocketses; the nassty noser has found it,  we says."   “We guesses, precious, only guesses. We  can’t know till we find the nassty creature and  squeezes it. But it doesn’t know what the  present can do, does it? It’ll just keep it in its  pocketses. It doesn’t know, and it can’t go far.  It’s lost itself, the nassty nosey thing. It doesn’t  know the way out. It said so.”   “It said so, yes; but it’s tricksy. It doesn’t say  what it means. It won’t say what it’s got in its  pocketses. It knows. It knows a way in, it must  know a way out, yes. It’s off to the back-door. To  the back-door, that’s it.”   “The goblinses will catch it then. It can’t get  out that way, precious.”   “Ssss, sss, gollum! Goblinses! Yes, but if  it’s got the present, our precious present, then  goblinses will get it, gollum! They’ll find it, they’ll  find out what it does. We shan’t ever be safe  again, never, gollum! One of the goblinses will  put it on, and then no one will see him. He’ll be  there but not seen. Not even our clever eyeses  will notice him; and he’ll come creepsy and  tricksy and catch us, gollum, gollum!”   “Then let’s stop talking, precious, and make     haste, tf the Baggins has gone that way, we  must go quick and see. Go! Not far now. Make  haste!”   With a spring Gollum got up and started  shambling off at a great pace. Bilbo hurried  after him, still cautiously, though his chief fear  now was of tripping on another snag and falling  with a noise. His head was in a whirl of hope  and wonder. It seemed that the ring he had was  a magic ring: it made you invisible! He had  heard of such things, of course, in old old tales;  but it was hard to believe that he really had  found one, by accident. Still there it was: Gollum  with his bright eyes had passed him by, only a  yard to one side.   On they went, Gollum flip-flapping ahead,  hissing and cursing; Bilbo behind going as  softly as a hobbit can. Soon they came to  places where, as Bilbo had noticed on the way  down, side-passages opened, this way and  that. Gollum began at once to count them.   “One left, yes. One right, yes. Two right, yes,  yes. Two left, yes, yes.” And so on and on.   As the count grew he slowed down, and he  began to get shaky and weepy; for he was  leaving the water further and further behind, and  he was getting afraid. Goblins might be about,  and he had lost his ring. At last he stopped by a  low opening, on their left as they went up.     “Seven right, yes. Six left, yes!” he  whispered. “This is it. This is the way to the  back-door, yes. Here’s the passage!”   He peered in, and shrank back. “But we  dursn’t go in, precious, no we dursn’t.  Goblinses down there. Lots of goblinses. We  smells them. Ssss!”   “What shall we do? Curse them and crush  them! We must wait here, precious, wait a bit  and see.”   So they came to a dead stop. Gollum had  brought Bilbo to the way out after all, but Bilbo  could not get in! There was Gollum sitting  humped up right in the opening, and his eyes  gleamed cold in his head, as he swayed it from  side to side between his knees.   Bilbo crept away from the wall more quietly  than a mouse; but Gollum stiffened at once, and  sniffed, and his eyes went green. He hissed  softly but menacingly. He could not see the  hobbit, but now he was on the alert, and he had  other senses that the darkness had sharpened:  hearing and smell. He seemed to be crouched  right down with his flat hands splayed on the  floor, and his head thrust out, nose almost to the  stone. Though he was only a black shadow in  the gleam of his own eyes, Bilbo could see or  feel that he was tense as a bowstring, gathered  for a spring.     Bilbo almost stopped breathing, and went  stiff himself. He was desperate. He must get  away, out of this horrible darkness, while he had  any strength left. He must fight. He must stab  the foul thing, put its eyes out, kill it. It meant to  kill him. No, not a fair fight. He was invisible  now. Gollum had no sword. Gollum had not  actually threatened to kill him, or tried to yet.  And he was miserable, alone, lost. A sudden  understanding, a pity mixed with horror, welled  up in Bilbo’s heart: a glimpse of endless  unmarked days without light or hope of  betterment, hard stone, cold fish, sneaking and  whispering. All these thoughts passed in a flash  of a second. He trembled. And then quite  suddenly in another flash, as if lifted by a new  strength and resolve, he leaped.   No great leap for a man, but a leap in the  dark. Straight over Gollum’s head he jumped,  seven feet forward and three in the air; indeed,  had he known it, he only just missed cracking  his skull on the low arch of the passage.   Gollum threw himself backwards, and  grabbed as the hobbit flew over him, but too  late: his hands snapped on thin air, and Bilbo,  falling fair on his sturdy feet, sped off down the  new tunnel. He did not turn to see what Gollum  was doing. There was a hissing and cursing  almost at his heels at first, then it stopped. All at     once there came a blood-curdling shriek, filled  with hatred and despair. Gollum was defeated.  He dared go no further. He had lost: lost his  prey, and lost, too, the only thing he had ever  cared for, his precious. The cry brought Bilbo’s  heart to his mouth, but still he held on. Now faint  as an echo, but menacing, the voice came  behind:   “Thief, thief, thief! Bag gins! We hates it, we  hates it, we hates it for ever!”   Then there was a silence. But that too  seemed menacing to Bilbo. “If goblins are so  near that he smelt them,” he thought, “then they’ll  have heard his shrieking and cursing. Careful  now, or this way will lead you to worse things.”   The passage was low and roughly made. It  was not too difficult for the hobbit, except when,  in spite of all care, he stubbed his poor toes  again, several times, on nasty jagged stones in  the floor. “A bit low for goblins, at least for the  big ones,” thought Bilbo, not knowing that even  the big ones, the ores of the mountains, go  along at a great speed stooping low with their  hands almost on the ground.   Soon the passage that had been sloping  down began to go up again, and after a while it  climbed steeply. That slowed Bilbo down. But at  last the slope stopped, the passage turned a  corner and dipped down again, and there, at     the bottom of a short incline, he saw, filtering  round another corner — a glimpse of light. Not  red light, as of fire or lantern, but a pale out-of-  doors sort of light. Then Bilbo began to run.   Scuttling as fast as his legs would carry him  he turned the last corner and came suddenly  right into an open space, where the light, after  all that time in the dark, seemed dazzlingly  bright. Really it was only a leak of sunshine in  through a doorway, where a great door, a stone  door, was left standing open.   Bilbo blinked, and then suddenly he saw the  goblins: goblins in full armour with drawn  swords sitting just inside the door, and watching  it with wide eyes, and watching the passage  that led to it. They were aroused, alert, ready for  anything.   They saw him sooner than he saw them.  Yes, they saw him. Whether it was an accident,  or a last trick of the ring before it took a new  master, it was not on his finger. With yells of  delight the goblins rushed upon him.   A pang of fear and loss, like an echo of  Gollum’s misery, smote Bilbo, and forgetting  even to draw his sword he struck his hands into  his pockets. And there was the ring still, in his  left pocket, and it slipped on his finger. The  goblins stopped short. They could not see a  sign of him. He had vanished. They yelled twice     as loud as before, but not so delightedly.   “Where is it?” they cried.   “Go back up the passage!” some shouted.   “This way!” some yelled. “That way!” others  yelled.   “Look out for the door,” bellowed the  captain.   Whistles blew, armour clashed, swords  rattled, goblins cursed and swore and ran hither  and thither, falling over one another and getting  very angry. There was a terrible outcry, to-do,  and disturbance.   Bilbo was dreadfully frightened, but he had  the sense to understand what had happened  and to sneak behind a big barrel which held  drink for the goblin-guards, and so get out of the  way and avoid being bumped into, trampled to  death, or caught by feel.   “I must get to the door, I must get to the  door!” he kept on saying to himself, but it was a  long time before he ventured to try. Then it was  like a horrible game of blind-man’s-buff. The  place was full of goblins running about, and the  poor little hobbit dodged this way and that, was  knocked over by a goblin who could not make  out what he had bumped into, scrambled away  on all fours, slipped between the legs of the  captain just in time, got up, and ran for the door.   It was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed it     nearly to. Bilbo struggled but he could not move  it. He tried to squeeze through the crack. He  squeezed and squeezed, and he stuck! It was  awful. His buttons had got wedged on the edge  of the door and the door-post. He could see  outside into the open air: there were a few  steps running down into a narrow valley  between tall mountains; the sun came out from  behind a cloud and shone bright on the outside  of the door — but he could not get through.   Suddenly one of the goblins inside shouted:  “There is a shadow by the door. Something is  outside!”   Bilbo’s heart jumped into his mouth. He  gave a terrific squirm. Buttons burst off in all  directions. He was through, with a torn coat and  waistcoat, leaping down the steps like a goat,  while bewildered goblins were still picking up  his nice brass buttons on the doorstep.   Of course they soon came down after him,  hooting and hallooing, and hunting among the  trees. But they don’t like the sun: it makes their  legs wobble and their heads giddy. They could  not find Bilbo with the ring on, slipping in and  out of the shadow of the trees, running quick  and quiet, and keeping out of the sun; so soon  they went back grumbling and cursing to guard  the door. Bilbo had escaped.       
Chapter VI    OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN INTO   THE FIRE    Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not  know where he was. He had lost hood, cloak,  food, pony, his buttons and his friends. He  wandered on and on, till the sun began to sink  westwards — behind the mountains. Their  shadows fell across Bilbo’s path, and he looked  back. Then he looked forward and could see  before him only ridges and slopes falling  towards lowlands and plains glimpsed  occasionally between the trees.   “Good heavens!” he exclaimed. “I seem to  have got right to the other side of the Misty  Mountains, right to the edge of the Land  Beyond! Where and O where can Gandalf and  the dwarves have got to? I only hope to  goodness they are not still back there in the  power of the goblins!”   He still wandered on, out of the little high  valley, over its edge, and down the slopes  beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable    thought was growing inside him. He wondered  whether he ought not, now he had the magic  ring, to go back into the horrible, horrible,  tunnels and look for his friends. He had just  made up his mind that it was his duty, that he  must turn back — and very miserable he felt  about it — when he heard voices.   He stopped and listened. It did not sound  like goblins; so he crept forward carefully. He  was on a stony path winding downwards with a  rocky wall on the left hand; on the other side the  ground sloped away and there were dells below  the level of the path overhung with bushes and  low trees. In one of these dells under the bushes  people were talking.   He crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw  peering between two big boulders a head with  a red hood on: it was Balin doing look-out. He  could have clapped and shouted for joy, but he  did not. He had still got the ring on, for fear of  meeting something unexpected and  unpleasant, and he saw that Balin was looking  straight at him without noticing him.   “I will give them all a surprise,” he thought,  as he crawled into the bushes at the edge of the  dell. Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves.  They were discussing all that had happened to  them in the tunnels, and wondering and  debating what they were to do now. The  dwarves were grumbling, and Gandalf was  saying that they could not possibly go on with     their journey leaving Mr. Baggins in the hands of  the goblins, without trying to find out if he was  alive or dead, and without trying to rescue him.   “After all he is my friend,” said the wizard,  “and not a bad little chap. I feel responsible for  him. I wish to goodness you had not lost him.”   The dwarves wanted to know why he had  ever been brought at all, why he could not stick  to his friends and come along with them, and  why the wizard had not chosen someone with  more sense. “He has been more trouble than  use so far,” said one. “If we have got to go back  now into those abominable tunnels to look for  him, then drat him, I say.”   Gandalf answered angrily: “I brought him,  and I don’t bring things that are of no use. Either  you help me to look for him, or I go and leave  you here to get out of the mess as best you can  yourselves. If we can only find him again, you  will thank me before all is over. Whatever did  you want to go and drop him for, Dori?”   “You would have dropped him,” said Dori,  “if a goblin had suddenly grabbed your legs  from behind in the dark, tripped up your feet,  and kicked you in the back!”   “Then why didn’t you pick him up again?”   “Good heavens! Can you ask! Goblins  fighting and biting in the dark, everybody falling  over bodies and hitting one another! You nearly  chopped off my head with Glamdring, and  Thorin was stabbing here there and everywhere     with Orcrist. All of a sudden you gave one of  your blinding flashes, and we saw the goblins  running back yelping. You shouted ‘follow me  everybody!' and everybody ought to have  followed. We thought everybody had. There was  no time to count, as you know quite well, till we  had dashed through the gate-guards, out of the  lower door, and helter-skelter down here. And  here we are — without the burglar, confusticate  him!”   “And here’s the burglar!” said Bilbo  stepping down into the middle of them, and  slipping off the ring.   Bless me, how they jumped! Then they  shouted with surprise and delight. Gandalf was  as astonished as any of them, but probably  more pleased than all the others. He called to  Balin and told him what he thought of a look-out  man who let people walk right into them like that  without warning. It is a fact that Bilbo’s  reputation went up a very great deal with the  dwarves after this. If they had still doubted that  he was really a first-class burglar, in spite of  Gandalf s words, they doubted no longer. Balin  was the most puzzled of all; but everyone said it  was a very clever bit of work.   Indeed Bilbo was so pleased with their  praise that he just chuckled inside and said  nothing whatever about the ring; and when they  asked him how he did it, he said: “Oh, just crept  along, you know — very carefully and quietly.”     “Well, It is the first time that even a mouse  has crept along carefully and quietly under my  very nose and not been spotted,” said Balin,  “and I take off my hood to you.” Which he did.   “Balin at your service,” said he.   “Your servant, Mr. Baggins,” said Bilbo.   Then they wanted to know all about his  adventures after they had lost him, and he sat  down and told them everything — except about  the finding of the ring (“not just now” he thought).  They were particularly interested in the riddle-  competition, and shuddered most  appreciatively at his description of Gollum.   “And then I couldn’t think of any other  question with him sitting beside me,” ended  Bilbo; “so I said ‘what’s in my pocket?’ And he  couldn’t guess in three goes. So I said: ‘what  about your promise? Show me the way out!’ But  he came at me to kill me, and I ran, and fell  over, and he missed me in the dark. Then I  followed him, because I heard him talking to  himself. He thought I really knew the way out,  and so he was making for it. And then he sat  down in the entrance, and I could not get by. So  I jumped over him and escaped, and ran down  to the gate.”   “What about the guards?” they asked.  “Weren’t there any?”   “O yes! lots of them; but I dodged ’em. I got  stuck in the door, which was only open a crack,  and I lost lots of buttons,” he said sadly looking     at his torn clothes. “But I squeezed through all  right — and here lam.”   The dwarves looked at him with quite a new  respect, when he talked about dodging guards,  jumping over Gollum, and squeezing through,  as if it was not very difficult or very alarming.   “What did I tell you?” said Gandalf laughing.  “Mr. Baggins has more about him than you  guess.” He gave Bilbo a queer look from under  his bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and the  hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his  tale that he had left out.   Then he had questions of his own to ask, for  if Gandalf had explained it all by now to the  dwarves, Bilbo had not heard it. He wanted to  know how the wizard had turned up again, and  where they had all got to now.   The wizard, to tell the truth, never minded  explaining his cleverness more than once, so  now he told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had  been well aware of the presence of evil goblins  in that part of the mountains. But their main gate  used to come out on a different pass, one more  easy to travel by, so that they often caught  people benighted near their gates. Evidently  people had given up going that way, and the  goblins must have opened their new entrance at  the top of the pass the dwarves had taken, quite  recently, because it had been found quite safe  up to now.   “I must see if I can’t find a more or less     decent giant to block it up again,” said Gandalf,  ‘‘or soon there will be no getting over the  mountains at all.”   As soon as Gandalf had heard Bilbo’s yell  he realized what had happened. In the flash  which killed the goblins that were grabbing him  he had nipped inside the crack, just as it  snapped to. He followed after the drivers and  prisoners right to the edge of the great hall, and  there he sat down and worked up the best  magic he could in the shadows.   “A very ticklish business, it was,” he said.  ‘‘Touch and go!”   But, of course, Gandalf had made a special  study of bewitchments with fire and lights (even  the hobbit had never forgotten the magic  fireworks at Old Took’s midsummer-eve  parties, as you remember). The rest we all  know — except that Gandalf knew all about the  back-door, as the goblins called the lower gate,  where Bilbo lost his buttons. As a matter of fact  it was well known to anybody who was  acquainted with this part of the mountains; but it  took a wizard to keep his head in the tunnels  and guide them in the right direction.   “They made that gate ages ago,” he said,  “partly for a way of escape, if they needed one;  partly as a way out into the lands beyond, where  they still come in the dark and do great  damage. They guard it always and no one has  ever managed to block it up. They will guard it     doubly after this,” he laughed.   All the others laughed too. After all they had  lost a good deal, but they had killed the Great  Goblin and a great many others besides, and  they had all escaped, so they might be said to  have had the best of it so far.   But the wizard called them to their senses.  ‘‘We must be getting on at once, now we are a  little rested,” he said. “They will be out after us in  hundreds when night comes on; and already  shadows are lengthening. They can smell our  footsteps for hours and hours after we have  passed. We must be miles on before dusk.  There will be a bit of moon, if it keeps fine, and  that is lucky. Not that they mind the moon much,  but it will give us a little light to steer by.”   “O yes!” he said in answer to more  questions from the hobbit. “You lose track of  time inside goblin-tunnels. Today’s Thursday,  and it was Monday night or Tuesday morning  that we were captured. We have gone miles  and miles, and come right down through the  heart of the mountains, and are now on the  other side — quite a short cut. But we are not at  the point to which our pass would have brought  us; we are too far to the North, and have some  awkward country ahead. And we are still pretty  high up. Let’s get on!”   “I am dreadfully hungry,” groaned Bilbo, who  was suddenly aware that he had not had a meal  since the night before the night before last. Just     think of that for a hobbit! His stomach felt all  empty and loose and his legs all wobbly, now  that the excitement was over.   “Can't help it,’’ said Gandalf, “unless you like  to go back and ask the goblins nicely to let you  have your pony back and your luggage.”   “No thank you!” said Bilbo.   “Very well then, we must just tighten our  belts and trudge on — or we shall be made into  supper, and that will be much worse than having  none ourselves.”   As they went on Bilbo looked from side to  side for something to eat; but the blackberries  were still only in flower, and of course there  were no nuts, not even hawthorn-berries. He  nibbled a bit of sorrel, and he drank from a  small mountain-stream that crossed the path,  and he ate three wild strawberries that he found  on its bank, but it was not much good.   They still went on and on. The rough path  disappeared. The bushes, and the long  grasses between the boulders, the patches of  rabbit-cropped turf, the thyme and the sage and  the marjoram, and the yellow rockroses all  vanished, and they found themselves at the top  of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, the  remains of a landslide. When they began to go  down this, rubbish and small pebbles rolled  away from their feet; soon larger bits of split  stone went clattering down and started other  pieces below them slithering and rolling; then     lumps of rock were disturbed and bounded off,  crashing down with a dust and a noise. Before  long the whole slope above them and below  them seemed on the move, and they were  sliding away, huddled all together, in a fearful  confusion of slipping, rattling, cracking slabs  and stones.   It was the trees at the bottom that saved  them. They slid into the edge of a climbing  wood of pines that here stood right up the  mountain slope from the deeper darker forests  of the valleys below. Some caught hold of the  trunks and swung themselves into lower  branches, some (like the little hobbit) got  behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of  the rocks. Soon the danger was over, the slide  had stopped, and the last faint crashes could  be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones  went bounding and spinning among the  bracken and the pine-roots far below.   “Well! that has got us on a bit,” said  Gandalf; “and even goblins tracking us will have  a job to come down here quietly.”   “I daresay,” grumbled Bombur; “but they  won’t find it difficult to send stones bouncing  down on our heads.” The dwarves (and Bilbo)  were feeling far from happy, and were rubbing  their bruised and damaged legs and feet.   “Nonsense! We are going to turn aside  here out of the path of the slide. We must be  quick! Look at the light!”     The sun had long gone behind the  mountains. Already the shadows were  deepening about them, though far away through  the trees and over the black tops of those  growing lower down they could still see the  evening lights on the plains beyond. They  limped along now as fast as they were able  down the gentle slopes of a pine forest in a  slanting path leading steadily southwards. At  times they were pushing through a sea of  bracken with tall fronds rising right above the  hobbit’s head; at times they were marching  along quiet as quiet over a floor of pine-  needles; and all the while the forest-gloom got  heavier and the forest-silence deeper. There  was no wind that evening to bring even a sea-  sighing into the branches of the trees.    “Must we go any further?” asked Bilbo, when it  was so dark that he could only just see Thorin's  beard wagging beside him, and so quiet that he  could hear the dwarves’ breathing like a loud  noise. “My toes are all bruised and bent, and  my legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like  an empty sack.”   “A bit further,” said Gandalf.   After what seemed ages further they came  suddenly to an opening where no trees grew.  The moon was up and was shining into the  clearing. Somehow it struck all of them as not at     all a nice place, although there was nothing  wrong to see.   All of a sudden they heard a howl away  down hill, a long shuddering howl. It was  answered by another away to the right and a  good deal nearer to them; then by another not  far away to the left. It was wolves howling at the  moon, wolves gathering together!   There were no wolves living near Mr.  Baggins’ hole at home, but he knew that noise.  He had had it described to him often enough in  tales. One of his elder cousins (on the Took  side), who had been a great traveller, used to  imitate it to frighten him. To hear it out in the  forest under the moon was too much for Bilbo.  Even magic rings are not much use against  wolves — especially against the evil packs that  lived under the shadow of the goblin-infested  mountains, over the Edge of the Wild on the  borders of the unknown. Wolves of that sort  smell keener than goblins, and do not need to  see you to catch you!   “What shall we do, what shall we do!” he  cried. “Escaping goblins to be caught by  wolves!” he said, and it became a proverb,  though we now say “out of the frying-pan into the  fire” in the same sort of uncomfortable  situations.   “Up the trees quick!” cried Gandalf; and  they ran to the trees at the edge of the glade,  hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or     were slender enough to swarm up. They found  them as quick as ever they could, you can  guess; and up they went as high as ever they  could trust the branches. You would have  laughed (from a safe distance), if you had seen  the dwarves sitting up in the trees with their  beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone  cracked and playing at being boys. Fili and Kili  were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous  Christmas tree. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin  were more comfortable in a huge pine with  regular branches sticking out at intervals like  the spokes of a wheel. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur,  and Thorin were in another. Dwalin and Balin  had swarmed up a tall slender fir with few  branches and were trying to find a place to sit in  the greenery of the topmost boughs. Gandalf,  who was a good deal taller than the others, had  found a tree into which they could not climb, a  large pine standing at the very edge of the  glade. He was quite hidden in its boughs, but  you could see his eyes gleaming in the moon  as he peeped out.   And Bilbo? He could not get into any tree,  and was scuttling about from trunk to trunk, like  a rabbit that has lost its hole and has a dog  after it.   “You’ve left the burglar behind again!’’ said  Nori to Dori looking down.   “I can’t be always carrying burglars on my  back,” said Dori, “down tunnels and up trees!     What do you think I am? A porter?”   “He’ll be eaten if we don't do something,”  said Thorin, for there were howls all round them  now, getting nearer and nearer. “Dori!” he  called, for Dori was lowest down in the easiest  tree, “be quick, and give Mr. Baggins a hand  up!”   Dori was really a decent fellow in spite of  his grumbling. Poor Bilbo could not reach his  hand even when he climbed down to the bottom  branch and hung his arm down as far as ever  he could. So Dori actually climbed out of the  tree and let Bilbo scramble up and stand on his  back.   Just at that moment the wolves trotted  howling into the clearing. All of a sudden there  were hundreds of eyes looking at them. Still  Dori did not let Bilbo down. He waited till he  had clambered off his shoulders into the  branches, and then he jumped for the branches  himself. Only just in time! A wolf snapped at his  cloak as he swung up, and nearly got him. In a  minute there was a whole pack of them yelping  all round the tree and leaping up at the trunk,  with eyes blazing and tongues hanging out.   But even the wild Wargs (for so the evil  wolves over the Edge of the Wild were named)  cannot climb trees. For a time they were safe.  Luckily it was warm and not windy. Trees are  not very comfortable to sit in for long at any  time; but in the cold and the wind, with wolves     all round below waiting for you, they can be  perfectly miserable places.   This glade in the ring of trees was evidently  a meeting-place of the wolves. More and more  kept coming in. They left guards at the foot of  the tree in which Dori and Bilbo were, and then  went snuffling about till they had smelt out every  tree that had anyone in it. These they guarded  too, while all the rest (hundreds and hundreds it  seemed) went and sat in a great circle in the  glade; and in the middle of the circle was a  great grey wolf. He spoke to them in the  dreadful language of the Wargs. Gandalf  understood it. Bilbo did not, but it sounded  terrible to him, and as if all their talk was about  cruel and wicked things, as it was. Every now  and then all the Wargs in the circle would  answer their grey chief all together, and their  dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall  out of his pine-tree.   I will tell you what Gandalf heard, though  Bilbo did not understand it. The Wargs and the  goblins often helped one another in wicked  deeds. Goblins do not usually venture very far  from their mountains, unless they are driven out  and are looking for new homes, or are  marching to war (which I am glad to say has not  happened for a long while). But in those days  they sometimes used to go on raids, especially  to get food or slaves to work for them. Then they  often got the Wargs to help and shared the     plunder with them. Sometimes they rode on  wolves like men do on horses. Now it seemed  that a great goblin-raid had been planned for  that very night. The Wargs had come to meet  the goblins and the goblins were late. The  reason, no doubt, was the death of the Great  Goblin, and all the excitement caused by the  dwarves and Bilbo and the wizard, for whom  they were probably still hunting.   In spite of the dangers of this far land bold  men had of late been making their way back  into it from the South, cutting down trees, and  building themselves places to live in among the  more pleasant woods in the valleys and along  the river-shores. There were many of them, and  they were brave and well-armed, and even the  Wargs dared not attack them if there were  many together, or in the bright day. But now they  had planned with the goblins’ help to come by  night upon some of the villages nearest the  mountains. If their plan had been carried out,  there would have been none left there next day;  all would have been killed except the few the  goblins kept from the wolves and carried back  as prisoners to their caves.   This was dreadful talk to listen to, not only  because of the brave woodmen and their wives  and children, but also because of the danger  which now threatened Gandalf and his friends.  The Wargs were angry and puzzled at finding  them here in their very meeting-place. They     thought they were friends of the woodmen, and  were come to spy on them, and would take  news of their plans down into the valleys, and  then the goblins and the wolves would have to  fight a terrible battle instead of capturing  prisoners and devouring people waked  suddenly from their sleep. So the Wargs had no  intention of going away and letting the people  up the trees escape, at any rate not until  morning. And long before that, they said, goblin  soldiers would be coming down from the  mountains; and goblins can climb trees, or cut  them down.   Now you can understand why Gandalf,  listening to their growling and yelping, began to  be dreadfully afraid, wizard though he was, and  to feel that they were in a very bad place, and  had not yet escaped at all. All the same he was  not going to let them have it all their own way,  though he could not do very much stuck up in a  tall tree with wolves all round on the ground  below. He gathered the huge pine-cones from  the branches of the tree. Then he set one alight  with bright blue fire, and threw it whizzing down  among the circle of the wolves. It struck one on  the back, and immediately his shaggy coat  caught fire, and he was leaping to and fro  yelping horribly. Then another came and  another, one in blue flames, one in red, another  in green. They burst on the ground in the middle  of the circle and went off in coloured sparks and     smoke. A specially large one hit the chief wolf  on the nose, and he leaped in the air ten feet,  and then rushed round and round the circle  biting and snapping even at the other wolves in  his anger and fright.   The dwarves and Bilbo shouted and  cheered. The rage of the wolves was terrible to  see, and the commotion they made filled all the  forest. Wolves are afraid of fire at all times, but  this was a most horrible and uncanny fire. If a  spark got in their coats it stuck and burned into  them, and unless they rolled over quick they  were soon all in flames. Very soon all about the  glade wolves were rolling over and over to put  out the sparks on their backs, while those that  were burning were running about howling and  setting others alight, till their own friends chased  them away and they fled off down the slopes  crying and yammering and looking for water.    "What is all this uproar in the forest tonight?”  said the Lord of the Eagles. He was sitting,  black in the moonlight, on the top of a lonely  pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the  mountains. “I hear wolves’ voices! Are the  goblins at mischief in the woods?”   He swept up into the air, and immediately  two of his guards from the rocks at either hand  leaped up to follow him. They circled up in the  sky and looked down upon the ring of the     Wargs, a tiny spot far far below. But eagles  have keen eyes and can see small things at a  great distance. The Lord of the Eagles of the  Misty Mountains had eyes that could look at the  sun unblinking, and could see a rabbit moving  on the ground a mile below even in the  moonlight. So though he could not see the  people in the trees, he could make out the  commotion among the wolves and see the tiny  flashes of fire, and hear the howling and yelping  come up faint from far beneath him. Also he  could see the glint of the moon on goblin spears  and helmets, as long lines of the wicked folk  crept down the hillsides from their gate and  wound into the wood.   Eagles are not kindly birds. Some are  cowardly and cruel. But the ancient race of the  northern mountains were the greatest of all  birds; they were proud and strong and noble-  hearted. They did not love goblins, or fear them.  When they took any notice of them at all (which  was seldom, for they did not eat such  creatures), they swooped on them and drove  them shrieking back to their caves, and  stopped whatever wickedness they were doing.  The goblins hated the eagles and feared them,  but could not reach their lofty seats, or drive  them from the mountains.   Tonight the Lord of the Eagles was filled  with curiosity to know what was afoot; so he  summoned many other eagles to him, and they     flew away from the mountains, and slowly  circling ever round and round they came down,  down, down towards the ring of the wolves and  the meeting-place of the goblins.   A very good thing too! Dreadful things had  been going on down there. The wolves that had  caught fire and fled into the forest had set it  alight in several places, it was high summer,  and on this eastern side of the mountains there  had been little rain for some time. Yellowing  bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine-  needles, and here and there dead trees, were  soon in flames. All round the clearing of the  Wargs fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did  not leave the trees. Maddened and angry they  were leaping and howling round the trunks, and  cursing the dwarves in their horrible language,  with their tongues hanging out, and their eyes  shining as red and fierce as the flames.   Then suddenly goblins came running up  yelling. They thought a battle with the woodmen  was going on; but they soon learned what had  really happened. Some of them actually sat  down and laughed. Others waved their spears  and clashed the shafts against their shields.  Goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had  a plan which seemed to them most amusing.   Some got all the wolves together in a pack.  Some stacked fern and brushwood round the  tree-trunks. Others rushed round and stamped  and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all     the flames were put out — but they did not put  out the fire nearest to the trees where the  dwarves were. That fire they fed with leaves and  dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a  ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves,  a ring which they kept from spreading outwards;  but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was  licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke  was in Bilbo’s eyes, he could feel the heat of  the flames; and through the reek he could see  the goblins dancing round and round in a circle  like people round a midsummer bonfire.  Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears  and axes stood the wolves at a respectful  distance, watching and waiting.   He could hear the goblins beginning a  horrible song:    Fifteen birds in five fir-trees,   their feathers were fanned in a fiery   breeze!   But, funny little birds, they had no wings!   O what shall we do with the funny little  things?   Roast ’em alive, orstewthem in a pot;  fry them, boil them and eat them hot?    Then they stopped and shouted out: “Fly  away little birds! Fly away if you can! Come  down little birds, or you will get roasted in your     nests! Sing, sing little birds! Why don’t you  sing?”   “Go away! little boys!” shouted Gandalf in  answer. “It isn’t bird-nesting time. Also naughty  little boys that play with fire get punished.” He  said it to make them angry, and to show them  he was not frightened of them — though of  course he was, wizard though he was. But they  took no notice, and they went on singing.    Bum, bum tree and fern!   Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch  To light the night for our delight,   Ya hey!   Bake and toast ’em, fry and roast ’em!  till beards blaze, and eyes glaze;  till hair smells and skins crack,  fat melts, and bones black  in cinders lie  beneath the sky!   So dwarves shall die,  and light the night for our delight,   Ya hey!   Ya-harri-hey!   Ya hoy!    And with that Ya hoy\ the flames were  under Gandalf s tree. In a moment it spread to  the others. The bark caught fire, the lower     branches cracked.   Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree.  The sudden splendour flashed from his wand  like lightning, as he got ready to spring down  from on high right among the spears of the  goblins. That would have been the end of him,  though he would probably have killed many of  them as he came hurtling down like a  thunderbolt. But he never leaped.   Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles  swept down from above, seized him in his  talons, and was gone.    There was a howl of anger and surprise from  the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles,  to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept  the great birds that were with him, and down  they came like huge black shadows. The  wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth; the  goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung  their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them  swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their  beating wings smote them to the floor or drove  them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces.  Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the  dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far  as they ever dared to go.   Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind  again! He just managed to catch hold of Dori’s  legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and up     they went together above the tumult and the  burning, Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms  nearly breaking.   Now far below the goblins and the wolves  were scattering far and wide in the woods. A  few eagles were still circling and sweeping  above the battleground. The flames about the  trees sprang suddenly up above the highest  branches. They went up in crackling fire. There  was a sudden flurry of sparks and smoke. Bilbo  had escaped only just in time!   Soon the light of the burning was faint  below, a red twinkle on the black floor; and they  were high up in the sky, rising all the time in  strong sweeping circles. Bilbo never forgot that  flight, clinging onto Dori’s ankles. He moaned  “my arms, my arms!”; but Dori groaned “my  poor legs, my poor legs!”   At the best of times heights made Bilbo  giddy. He used to turn queer if he looked over  the edge of quite a little cliff; and he had never  liked ladders, let alone trees (never having had  to escape from wolves before). So you can  imagine how his head swam now, when he  looked down between his dangling toes and  saw the dark lands opening wide underneath  him, touched here and there with the light of the  moon on a hill-side rock or a stream in the  plains.   The pale peaks of the mountains were  coming nearer, moonlit spikes of rock sticking     out of black shadows. Summer or not, it  seemed very cold. He shut his eyes and  wondered if he could hold on any longer. Then  he imagined what would happen if he did not.  He felt sick.   The flight ended only just in time for him, just  before his arms gave way. He loosed Dori’s  ankles with a gasp and fell onto the rough  platform of an eagle’s eyrie. There he lay  without speaking, and his thoughts were a  mixture of surprise at being saved from the fire,  and fear lest he fall off that narrow place into the  deep shadows on either side. He was feeling  very queer indeed in his head by this time after  the dreadful adventures of the last three days  with next to nothing to eat, and he found himself  saying aloud: “Now I know what a piece of  bacon feels like when it is suddenly picked out  of the pan on a fork and put back on the shelf!”   “No you don’t!” he heard Dori answering,  “because the bacon knows that it will get back  in the pan sooner or later; and it is to be hoped  we shan’t. Also eagles aren’t forks!”   “O no! Not a bit like storks — forks, I mean,”  said Bilbo sitting up and looking anxiously at  the eagle who was perched close by. He  wondered what other nonsense he had been  saying, and if the eagle would think it rude. You  ought not to be rude to an eagle, when you are  only the size of a hobbit, and are up in his eyrie  at night!     The eagle only sharpened his beak on a  stone and trimmed his feathers and took no  notice.   Soon another eagle flew up. “The Lord of  the Eagles bids you to bring your prisoners to  the Great Shelf,” he cried and was off again.  The other seized Dori in his claws and flew  away with him into the night leaving Bilbo all  alone. He had just strength to wonder what the  messenger had meant by ‘prisoners,’ and to  begin to think of being torn up for supper like a  rabbit, when his own turn came.   The eagle came back, seized him in his  talons by the back of his coat, and swooped off.  This time he flew only a short way. Very soon  Bilbo was laid down, trembling with fear, on a  wide shelf of rock on the mountain-side. There  was no path down on to it save by flying; and no  path down off it except by jumping over a  precipice. There he found all the others sitting  with their backs to the mountain wall. The Lord  of the Eagles also was there and was speaking  to Gandalf.   It seemed that Bilbo was not going to be  eaten after all. The wizard and the eagle-lord  appeared to know one another slightly, and  even to be on friendly terms. As a matter of fact  Gandalf, who had often been in the mountains,  had once rendered a service to the eagles and  healed their lord from an arrow-wound. So you  see ‘prisoners’ had meant ‘prisoners rescued     from the goblins’ only, and not captives of the  eagles. As Bilbo listened to the talk of Gandalf  he realized that at last they were going to  escape really and truly from the dreadful  mountains. He was discussing plans with the  Great Eagle for carrying the dwarves and  himself and Bilbo far away and setting them  down well on their journey across the plains  below.      The Misty Mountains looking West from the  Eyrie towards Goblin Gate    The Lord of the Eagles would not take them  anywhere near where men lived. “They would  shoot at us with their great bows of yew,” he  said, “for they would think we were after their  sheep. And at other times they would be right.  No! we are glad to cheat the goblins of their  sport, and glad to repay our thanks to you, but  we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the  southward plains.”   “Very well,” said Gandalf. “Take us where  and as far as you will! We are already deeply  obliged to you. But in the meantime we are  famished with hunger.”   “I am nearly dead of it,” said Bilbo in a weak  little voice that nobody heard.   “That can perhaps be mended,” said the  Lord of the Eagles.   Later on you might have seen a bright fire  on the shelf of rock and the figures of the  dwarves round it cooking and making a fine  roasting smell. The eagles had brought up dry  boughs for fuel, and they had brought rabbits,  hares, and a small sheep. The dwarves  managed all the preparations. Bilbo was too  weak to help, and anyway he was not much  good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat,  being used to having it delivered by the butcher     all ready to cook. Gandalf, too, was lying down  after doing his part in setting the fire going,  since Oin and Gloin had lost their tinder-boxes.  (Dwarves have never taken to matches even  yet.)   So ended the adventures of the Misty  Mountains. Soon Bilbo’s stomach was feeling  full and comfortable again, and he felt he could  sleep contentedly, though really he would have  liked a loaf and butter better than bits of meat  toasted on sticks. He slept curled up on the  hard rock more soundly than ever he had done  on his feather-bed in his own little hole at home.  But all night he dreamed of his own house and  wandered in his sleep into all his different  rooms looking for something that he could not  find nor remember what it looked like.      
Chapter VII    QUEER LODGINGS    The next morning Bilbo woke up with the early  sun in his eyes. He jumped up to look at the  time and to go and put his kettle on — and found  he was not home at all. So he sat down and  wished in vain for a wash and a brush. He did  not get either, nor tea nor toast nor bacon for  his breakfast, only cold mutton and rabbit. And  after that he had to get ready for a fresh start.   This time he was allowed to climb on to an  eagle’s back and cling between his wings. The  air rushed over him and he shut his eyes. The  dwarves were crying farewells and promising to  repay the Lord of the Eagles if ever they could,  as off rose fifteen great birds from the  mountain’s side. The sun was still close to the  eastern edge of things. The morning was cool,  and mists were in the valleys and hollows and  twined here and there about the peaks and  pinnacles of the hills. Bilbo opened an eye to  peep and saw that the birds were already high    up and the world was far away, and the  mountains were falling back behind them into  the distance. He shut his eyes again and held  on tighter.   “Don’t pinch!” said his eagle. “You need not  be frightened like a rabbit, even if you look  rather like one. It is a fair morning with little  wind. What is finer than flying?”   Bilbo would have liked to say: “A warm bath  and late breakfast on the lawn afterwards;” but  he thought it better to say nothing at all, and to  let go his clutch just a tiny bit.   After a good while the eagles must have  seen the point they were making for, even from  their great height, for they began to go down  circling round in great spirals. They did this for a  long while, and at last the hobbit opened his  eyes again. The earth was much nearer, and  below them were trees that looked like oaks  and elms, and wide grass lands, and a river  running through it all. But cropping out of the  ground, right in the path of the stream which  looped itself about it, was a great rock, almost  a hill of stone, like a last outpost of the distant  mountains, or a huge piece cast miles into the  plain by some giant among giants.   Quickly now to the top of this rock the  eagles swooped one by one and set down their  passengers.   “Farewell!” they cried, “wherever you fare,     till your eyries receive you at the journey’s end!”  That is the polite thing to say among eagles.   “May the wind under your wings bear you  where the sun sails and the moon walks,”  answered Gandalf, who knew the correct reply.   And so they parted. And though the Lord of  the Eagles became in after days the King of All  Birds and wore a golden crown, and his fifteen  chieftains golden collars (made of the gold that  the dwarves gave them), Bilbo never saw them  again — except high and far off in the battle of  Five Armies. But as that comes in at the end of  this tale we will say no more about it just now.   There was a flat space on the top of the hill  of stone and a well worn path with many steps  leading down it to the river, across which a ford  of huge flat stones led to the grass-land beyond  the stream. There was a little cave (a  wholesome one with a pebbly floor) at the foot  of the steps and near the end of the stony ford.  Here the party gathered and discussed what  was to be done.   “I always meant to see you all safe (if  possible) over the mountains,” said the wizard,  “and now by good management and good luck I  have done it. Indeed we are now a good deal  further east than I ever meant to come with you,  for after all this is not my adventure. I may look  in on it again before it is all over, but in the  meanwhile I have some other pressing     business to attend to.”   The dwarves groaned and looked most  distressed, and Bilbo wept. They had begun to  think Gandalf was going to come all the way  and would always be there to help them out of  difficulties. “I am not going to disappear this  very instant,” said he. “I can give you a day or  two more. Probably I can help you out of your  present plight, and I need a little help myself.  We have no food, and no baggage, and no  ponies to ride; and you don’t know where you  are. Now I can tell you that. You are still some  miles north of the path which we should have  been following, if we had not left the mountain  pass in a hurry. Very few people live in these  parts, unless they have come here since I was  last down this way, which is some years ago.  But there is somebody that I know of, who lives  not far away. That Somebody made the steps  on the great rock — the Carrock I believe he  calls it. He does not come here often, certainly  not in the daytime, and it is no good waiting for  him. In fact it would be very dangerous. We  must go and find him; and if all goes well at our  meeting, I think I shall be off and wish you like  the eagles ‘farewell wherever you fare! ' ”   They begged him not to leave them. They  offered him dragon-gold and silver and jewels,  but he would not change his mind. “We shall  see, we shall see!” he said, “and I think I have     earned already some of your dragon-gold —  when you have got it.”    After that they stopped pleading. Then they took  off their clothes and bathed in the river, which  was shallow and clear and stony at the ford.  When they had dried in the sun, which was now  strong and warm, they were refreshed, if still  sore and a little hungry. Soon they crossed the  ford (carrying the hobbit), and then began to  march through the long green grass and down  the lines of the wide-armed oaks and the tall  elms.   “And why is it called the Carrock?” asked  Bilbo as he went along at the wizard’s side.   “He called it the Carrock, because carrock  is his word for it. He calls things like that  carrocks, and this one is the Carrock because  it is the only one near his home and he knows it  well.”   “Who calls it? Who knows it?”   “The Somebody I spoke of — a very great  person. You must all be very polite when I  introduce you. I shall introduce you slowly, two  by two, I think; and you must be careful not to  annoy him, or heaven knows what will happen.  He can be appalling when he is angry, though  he is kind enough if humoured. Still I warn you     he gets angry easily.”   The dwarves all gathered round when they  heard the wizard talking like this to Bilbo. “Is  that the person you are taking us to now?” they  asked. “Couldn’t you find someone more easy-  tempered? Hadn't you better explain it all a bit  clearer?” — and so on.   “Yes it certainly is! No I could not! And I was  explaining very carefully” answered the wizard  crossly. “If you must know more, his name is  Beorn. He is very strong, and he is a skin-  changer.”   “What! a furrier, a man that calls rabbits  conies, when he doesn’t turn their skins into  squirrels?” asked Bilbo.   “Good gracious heavens, no, no, NO, NO!”  said Gandalf. “Don’t be a fool Mr. Baggins if  you can help it; and in the name of all wonder  don’t mention the word furrier again as long as  you are within a hundred miles of his house, nor  rug, cape, tippet, muff, nor any other such  unfortunate word! He is a skin-changer. He  changes his skin: sometimes he is a huge  black bear, sometimes he is a great strong  black-haired man with huge arms and a great  beard. I cannot tell you much more, though that  ought to be enough. Some say that he is a bear  descended from the great and ancient bears of  the mountains that lived there before the giants  came. Others say that he is a man descended     from the first men who lived before Smaug or  the other dragons came into this part of the  world, and before the goblins came into the hills  out of the North. I cannot say, though I fancy the  last is the true tale. He is not the sort of person  to ask questions of.   “At any rate he is under no enchantment but  his own. He lives in an oak-wood and has a  great wooden house; and as a man he keeps  cattle and horses which are nearly as  marvellous as himself. They work for him and  talk to him. He does not eat them; neither does  he hunt or eat wild animals. He keeps hives and  hives of great fierce bees, and lives most on  cream and honey. As a bear he ranges far and  wide. I once saw him sitting all alone on the top  of the Carrock at night watching the moon  sinking towards the Misty Mountains, and I  heard him growl in the tongue of bears: The  day will come when they will perish and I shall  go back!’ That is why I believe he once came  from the mountains himself.”    Bilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think  about, and they asked no more questions. They  still had a long way to walk before them. Up  slope and down dale they plodded. It grew very  hot. Sometimes they rested under the trees,  and then Bilbo felt so hungry that he would have     eaten acorns, if any had been ripe enough yet  to have fallen to the ground.   It was the middle of the afternoon before  they noticed that great patches of flowers had  begun to spring up, all the same kinds growing  together as if they had been planted. Especially  there was clover, waving patches of cockscomb  clover, and purple clover, and wide stretches of  short white sweet honey-smelling clover. There  was a buzzing and a whirring and a droning in  the air. Bees were busy everywhere. And such  bees! Bilbo had never seen anything like them.   “If one was to sting me,” he thought, “I  should swell up as big again as I am!”   They were bigger than hornets. The drones  were bigger than your thumb, a good deal, and  the bands of yellow on their deep black bodies  shone like fiery gold.   “We are getting near,” said Gandalf. “We  are on the edge of his bee-pastures.”    After a while they came to a belt of tall and very  ancient oaks, and beyond these to a high thorn-  hedge through which you could neither see nor  scramble.   “You had better wait here,” said the wizard  to the dwarves; “and when I call or whistle begin  to come after me — you will see the way I go —     but only in pairs, mind, about five minutes  between each pair of you. Bombur is fattest and  will do for two, he had better come alone and  last. Come on Mr. Baggins! There is a gate  somewhere round this way.” And with that he  went off along the hedge taking the frightened  hobbit with him.   They soon came to a wooden gate, high  and broad, beyond which they could see  gardens and a cluster of low wooden buildings,  some thatched and made of unshaped logs:  barns, stables, sheds, and a long low wooden  house. Inside on the southward side of the great  hedge were rows and rows of hives with bell-  shaped tops made of straw. The noise of the  giant bees flying to and fro and crawling in and  out filled all the air.   The wizard and the hobbit pushed open the  heavy creaking gate and went down a wide  track towards the house. Some horses, very  sleek and well-groomed, trotted up across the  grass and looked at them intently with very  intelligent faces; then off they galloped to the  buildings.   “They have gone to tell him of the arrival of  strangers,” said Gandalf.   Soon they reached a courtyard, three walls  of which were formed by the wooden house and  its two long wings. In the middle there was lying  a great oak-trunk with many lopped branches     beside it. Standing near was a huge man with a  thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms  and legs with knotted muscles. He was clothed  in a tunic of wool down to his knees, and was  leaning on a large axe. The horses were  standing by him with their noses at his shoulder.   “Ugh! here they are!” he said to the horses.  “They don’t look dangerous. You can be off!” He  laughed a great rolling laugh, put down his axe  and came forward.   “Who are you and what do you want?” he  asked gruffly, standing in front of them and  towering tall above Gandalf. As for Bilbo he  could easily have trotted through his legs  without ducking his head to miss the fringe of  the man’s brown tunic.   “I am Gandalf,” said the wizard.   “Never heard of him,” growled the man.  “And what’s this little fellow?” he said, stooping  down to frown at the hobbit with his bushy black  eyebrows.   “That is Mr. Baggins, a hobbit of good  family and unimpeachable reputation,” said  Gandalf. Bilbo bowed. He had no hat to take  off, and was painfully conscious of his many  missing buttons. “I am a wizard,” continued  Gandalf. “I have heard of you, if you have not  heard of me; but perhaps you have heard of my  good cousin Radagast who lives near the  Southern borders of Mirkwood?”     “Yes; not a bad fellow as wizards go, I  believe. I used to see him now and again,” said  Beorn. “Well, now I know who you are, or who  you say you are. What do you want?”   “To tell you the truth, we have lost our  luggage and nearly lost our way, and are rather  in need of help, or at least of advice. I may say  we have had rather a bad time with goblins in  the mountains.”   “Goblins?” said the big man less gruffly. “O  ho, so you’ve been having trouble with them  have you? What did you go near them for?”   “We did not mean to. They surprised us at  night in a pass which we had to cross; we were  coming out of the Lands over West into these  countries — it is a long tale.”   “Then you had better come inside and tell  me some of it, if it won’t take all day,” said the  man leading the way through a dark door that  opened out of the courtyard into the house.   Following him they found themselves in a  wide hall with a fire-place in the middle. Though  it was summer there was a wood-fire burning  and the smoke was rising to the blackened  rafters in search of the way out through an  opening in the roof. They passed through this  dim hall, lit only by the fire and the hole above it,  and came through another smaller door into a  sort of veranda propped on wooden posts  made of single tree-trunks. It faced south and      was still warm and filled with the light of the  westering sun which slanted into it, and fell  golden on the garden full of flowers that came  right up to the steps.      foRo'smi    Here they sat on wooden benches while  Gandalf began his tale, and Bilbo swung his  dangling legs and looked at the flowers in the  garden, wondering what their names could be,  as he had never seen half of them before.   “I was coming over the mountains with a  friend or two. . .” said the wizard.   “Or two? I can only see one, and a little one  at that,” said Beorn.   “Well to tell you the truth, I did not like to  bother you with a lot of us, until I found out if you  were busy. I will give a call, if I may.”   “Go on, call away!”   So Gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and  presently Thorin and Dori came round the  house by the garden path and stood bowing low  before them.   “One or three you meant, I see!” said Beorn.  “But these aren’t hobbits, they are dwarves!”   “Thorin Oakenshield, at your service! Dori  at your service!” said the two dwarves bowing  again.   “I don’t need your service, thank you,” said    Beorn, “but I expect you need mine. I am not  over fond of dwarves; but if it is true you are  Thorin (son of Thrain, son of Thror, I believe),  and that your companion is respectable, and  that you are enemies of goblins and are not up  to any mischief in my lands — what are you up  to, by the way?”   “They are on their way to visit the land of  their fathers, away east beyond Mirkwood,” put  in Gandalf, “and it is entirely an accident that we  are in your lands at all. We were crossing by the  High Pass that should have brought us to the  road that lies to the south of your country, when  we were attacked by the evil goblins — as I was  about to tell you.”   “Go on telling, then!” said Beorn, who was  never very polite.   “There was a terrible storm; the stone-  giants were out hurling rocks, and at the head of  the pass we took refuge in a cave, the hobbit  and I and several of our companions. . .”   “Do you call two several?”   “Well, no. As a matter of fact there were  more than two.”   “Where are they? Killed, eaten, gone  home?”   “Well, no. They don’t seem all to have come  when I whistled. Shy, I expect. You see, we are  very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you  to entertain.”     “Go on, whistle again! lam in for a party, it  seems, and one or two more won’t make much  difference,” growled Beorn.   Gandalf whistled again; but Nori and Ori  were there almost before he had stopped, for, if  you remember, Gandalf had told them to come  in pairs every five minutes.   “Hullo!” said Beorn. “You came pretty quick  — where were you hiding? Come on my jack-in-  the-boxes!”   “Nori at your service, Ori at. . .” they began;  but Beorn interrupted them.   “Thank you! When I want your help I will ask  for it. Sit down, and let’s get on with this tale, or  it will be supper-time before it is ended.”   “As soon as we were asleep,” went on  Gandalf, “a crack at the back of the cave  opened; goblins came out and grabbed the  hobbit and the dwarves and our troop of ponies   “Troop of ponies? What were you — a  travelling circus? Or were you carrying lots of  goods? Or do you always call six a troop?”   “O no! As a matter of fact there were more  than six ponies, for there were more than six of  us — and well, here are two more!” Just at that  moment Balin and Dwalin appeared and  bowed so low that their beards swept the stone  floor. The big man was frowning at first, but they  did their best to be frightfully polite, and kept on     nodding and bending and bowing and waving  their hoods before their knees (in proper dwarf-  fashion), till he stopped frowning and burst into  a chuckling laugh: they looked so comical.   “Troop, was right,” he said. “A fine comic  one. Come in my merry men, and what are your  names? I don’t want your service just now, only  your names; and then sit down and stop  wagging!”   “Balin and Dwalin,” they said not daring to  be offended, and sat flop on the floor looking  rather surprised.   “Now go on again!” said Beorn to the  wizard.   “Where was I? O yes — I was not grabbed. I  killed a goblin or two with a flash — ”   “Good!” growled Beorn. “It is some good  being a wizard, then.”   “ — and slipped inside the crack before it  closed. I followed down into the main hall, which  was crowded with goblins. The Great Goblin  was there with thirty or forty armed guards. I  thought to myself ‘even if they were not all  chained together, what can a dozen do against  so many?’”   “A dozen! That’s the first time I've heard  eight called a dozen. Or have you still got some  more jacks that haven’t yet come out of their  boxes?”   “Well, yes, there seem to be a couple more     here now — Fili and Kili, I believe,” said Gandalf,  as these two now appeared and stood smiling  and bowing.   “That’s enough!” said Beorn. “Sit down and  be quiet! Now go on, Gandalf!”   So Gandalf went on with the tale, until he  came to the fight in the dark, the discovery of  the lower gate, and their horror when they found  that Mr. Baggins had been mislaid. “We  counted ourselves and found that there was no  hobbit. There were only fourteen of us left!”   “Fourteen! That’s the first time I’ve heard  one from ten leave fourteen. You mean nine, or  else you haven’t told me yet all the names of  your party.”   “Well, of course you haven’t seen Oin and  Gloin yet. And, bless me! here they are. I hope  you will forgive them for bothering you.”   “O let ’em all come! Hurry up! Come along,  you two, and sit down! But look here, Gandalf,  even now we have only got yourself and ten  dwarves and the hobbit that was lost. That only  makes eleven (plus one mislaid) and not  fourteen, unless wizards count differently to  other people. But now please get on with the  tale.” Beorn did not show it more than he could  help, but really he had begun to get very  interested. You see, in the old days he had  known the very part of the mountains that  Gandalf was describing. He nodded and he     growled, when he heard of the hobbit’s  reappearance and of their scramble down the  stone-slide and of the wolf-ring in the woods.   When Gandalf came to their climbing into  trees with the wolves all underneath, he got up  and strode about and muttered: “I wish I had  been there! I would have given them more than  fireworks!”   “Well,” said Gandalf very glad to see that  his tale was making a good impression, “I did  the best I could. There we were with the wolves  going mad underneath us and the forest  beginning to blaze in places, when the goblins  came down from the hills and discovered us.  They yelled with delight and sang songs making  fun of us. Fifteen birds in live fir-trees . .   “Good heavens!” growled Beorn. “Don’t  pretend that goblins can’t count. They can.  Twelve isn't fifteen and they know it.”   “And so do I. There were Bifur and Bofur as  well. I haven’t ventured to introduce them  before, but here they are.”   In came Bifur and Bofur. “And me!” gasped  Bombur puffing up behind. He was fat, and also  angry at being left till last. He refused to wait  five minutes, and followed immediately after the  other two.   “Well, now there are fifteen of you; and  since goblins can count, I suppose that is all  that there were up the trees. Now perhaps we     can finish this story without any more  interruptions.” Mr. Baggins saw then how clever  Gandalf had been. The interruptions had really  made Beorn more interested in the story, and  the story had kept him from sending the  dwarves off at once like suspicious beggars.  He never invited people into his house, if he  could help it. He had very few friends and they  lived a good way away; and he never invited  more than a couple of these to his house at a  time. Now he had got fifteen strangers sitting in  his porch!   By the time the wizard had finished his tale  and had told of the eagles’ rescue and of how  they had all been brought to the Carrock, the  sun had fallen behind the peaks of the Misty  Mountains and the shadows were long in  Beorn’s garden.   “Avery good tale!” said he. “The best I have  heard for a long while. If all beggars could tell  such a good one, they might find me kinder.  You may be making it all up, of course, but you  deserve a supper for the story all the same.  Let’s have something to eat!”   “Yes please!” they all said together. “Thank  you very much!”    Inside the hall it was now quite dark. Beorn  clapped his hands, and in trotted four beautiful     white ponies and several large long-bodied  grey dogs. Beorn said something to them in a  queer language like animal noises turned into  talk. They went out again and soon came back  carrying torches in their mouths, which they lit at  the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars  of the hall about the central hearth. The dogs  could stand on their hind-legs when they  wished, and carry things with their fore-feet.  Quickly they got out boards and trestles from  the side walls and set them up near the fire.   Then baa — baa — baa! was heard, and in  came some snow-white sheep led by a large  coal-black ram. One bore a white cloth  embroidered at the edges with figures of  animals; others bore on their broad backs trays  with bowls and platters and knives and wooden  spoons, which the dogs took and quickly laid on  the trestle-tables. These were very low, low  enough even for Bilbo to sit at comfortably.  Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated  benches with wide rush-bottoms and little short  thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the  far end he put Beorn’s big black chair of the  same sort (in which he sat with his great legs  stuck far out under the table). These were all the  chairs he had in his hall, and he probably had  them low like the tables for the convenience of  the wonderful animals that waited on him. What  did the rest sit on? They were not forgotten. The     other ponies came in rolling round drum-  shaped sections of logs, smoothed and  polished, and low enough even for Bilbo; so  soon they were all seated at Beorn’s table, and  the hall had not seen such a gathering for many  a year.   There they had a supper, or a dinner, such  as they had not had since they left the Last  Homely House in the West and said good-bye  to Elrond. The light of the torches and the fire  flickered about them, and on the table were two  tall red beeswax candles. All the time they ate,  Beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of the  wild lands on this side of the mountains, and  especially of the dark and dangerous wood,  that lay outstretched far to North and South a  day’s ride before them, barring their way to the  East, the terrible forest of Mirkwood.   The dwarves listened and shook their  beards, for they knew that they must soon  venture into that forest and that after the  mountains it was the worst of the perils they had  to pass before they came to the dragon’s  stronghold. When dinner was over they began  to tell tales of their own, but Beorn seemed to  be growing drowsy and paid little heed to them.  They spoke most of gold and silver and jewels  and the making of things by smith-craft, and  Beorn did not appear to care for such things:  there were no things of gold or silver in his hall,     and few save the knives were made of metal at  all.   They sat long at the table with their wooden  drinking-bowls filled with mead. The dark night  came on outside. The fires in the middle of the  hall were built with fresh logs and the torches  were put out, and still they sat in the light of the  dancing flames with the pillars of the house  standing tall behind them, and dark at the top  like trees of the forest. Whether it was magic or  not, it seemed to Bilbo that he heard a sound  like wind in the branches stirring in the rafters,  and the hoot of owls. Soon he began to nod  with sleep and the voices seemed to grow far  away, until he woke with a start.   The great door had creaked and slammed.  Beorn was gone. The dwarves were sitting  cross-legged on the floor round the fire, and  presently they began to sing. Some of the  verses were like this, but there were many  more, and their singing went on for a long while:    The wind was on the withered heath,  but in the forest stirred no leaf:  there shadows lay by night and day,  and dark things silent crept beneath.     The wind came down from mountains  cold,   and like a tide it roared and rolled;  the branches groaned, the forest moaned,  and leaves were laid upon the mould.    The wind went on from West to East;  all movement in the forest ceased,  but shrill and harsh across the marsh  its whistling voices were released.    The grasses hissed, their tassels bent,  the reeds were rattling — on it went  o’er shaken pool under heavens cool  where racing clouds were tom and rent.    It passed the lonely Mountain bare  and swept above the dragon’s lair:  there black and dark lay boulders stark  and flying smoke was in the air.     It left the world and took its flight  over the wide seas of the night.   The moon set sail upon the gale,  and stars were fanned to leaping light.    Bilbo began to nod again. Suddenly up  stood Gandalf.   “It is time for us to sleep,’’ he said, “ — for us,  but not I think for Beorn. In this hall we can rest  sound and safe, but I warn you all not to forget  what Beorn said before he left us: you must not  stray outside until the sun is up, on your peril.”   Bilbo found that beds had already been laid  at the side of the hall, on a sort of raised  platform between the pillars and the outer wall.  For him there was a little mattress of straw and  woollen blankets. He snuggled into them very  gladly, summertime though it was. The fire  burned low and he fell asleep. Yet in the night  he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few  embers; the dwarves and Gandalf were all  asleep, to judge by their breathing; a splash of  white on the floor came from the high moon,  which was peering down through the smoke-  hole in the roof.   There was a growling sound outside, and a  noise as of some great animal scuffling at the  door. Bilbo wondered what it was, and whether  it could be Beorn in enchanted shape, and if he     would come in as a bear and kill them. He  dived under the blankets and hid his head, and  fell asleep again at last in spite of his fears.    It was full morning when he awoke. One of the  dwarves had fallen over him in the shadows  where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump  from the platform on to the floor. It was Bofur,  and he was grumbling about it, when Bilbo  opened his eyes.   “Get up lazybones,” he said, “or there will be  no breakfast left for you.”   Up jumped Bilbo. “Breakfast!” he cried.  “Where is breakfast?”   “Mostly inside us,” answered the other  dwarves who were moving about the hall; “but  what is left is out on the veranda. We have been  about looking for Beorn ever since the sun got  up; but there is no sign of him anywhere, though  we found breakfast laid as soon as we went  out.”   “Where is Gandalf?” asked Bilbo, moving  off to find something to eat as quick as he  could.   “O! out and about somewhere,” they told  him. But he saw no sign of the wizard all that  day until the evening. Just before sunset he  walked into the hall, where the hobbit and the  dwarves were having supper, waited on by     Beorn’s wonderful animals, as they had been all  day. Of Beorn they had seen and heard nothing  since the night before, and they were getting  puzzled.   “Where is our host, and where have you  been all day yourself?” they all cried.   “One question at a time — and none till after  supper! I haven’t had a bite since breakfast.”   At last Gandalf pushed away his plate and  jug — he had eaten two whole loaves (with  masses of butter and honey and clotted cream)  and drunk at least a quart of mead — and he  took out his pipe. “I will answer the second  question first,” he said, “ — but bless me! this is  a splendid place for smoke rings!” Indeed for a  long time they could get nothing more out of  him, he was so busy sending smoke rings  dodging round the pillars of the hall, changing  them into all sorts of different shapes and  colours, and setting them at last chasing one  another out of the hole in the roof. They must  have looked very queer from outside, popping  out into the air one after another, green, blue,  red, silver-grey, yellow, white; big ones, little  ones; little ones dodging through big ones and  joining into figure-eights, and going off like a  flock of birds into the distance.   “I have been picking out bear-tracks,” he  said at last. “There must have been a regular  bears’ meeting outside here last night. I soon     saw that Beorn could not have made them all:  there were far too many of them, and they were  of various sizes too. I should say there were  little bears, large bears, ordinary bears, and  gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from  dark to nearly dawn. They came from almost  every direction, except from the west over the  river, from the Mountains. In that direction only  one set of footprints led — none coming, only  ones going away from here. I followed these as  far as the Carrock. There they disappeared into  the river, but the water was too deep and strong  beyond the rock for me to cross. It is easy  enough, as you remember, to get from this bank  to the Carrock by the ford, but on the other side  is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel. I  had to walk miles before I found a place where  the river was wide and shallow enough for me  to wade and swim, and then miles back again  to pick up the tracks again. By that time it was  too late for me to follow them far. They went  straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on  the east side of the Misty Mountains, where we  had our pleasant little party with the Wargs the  night before last. And now I think I have  answered your first question, too,” ended  Gandalf, and he sat a long while silent.   Bilbo thought he knew what the wizard  meant. “What shall we do,” he cried, “if he leads  all the Wargs and the goblins down here? We     shall all be caught and killed! I thought you said  he was not a friend of theirs.”   “So I did. And don’t be silly! You had better  go to bed, your wits are sleepy.”   The hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there  seemed nothing else to do he did go to bed;  and while the dwarves were still singing songs  he dropped asleep, still puzzling his little head  about Beorn, till he dreamed a dream of  hundreds of black bears dancing slow heavy  dances round and round in the moonlight in the  courtyard. Then he woke up when everyone  else was asleep, and he heard the same  scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and growling as  before.   Next morning they were all wakened by  Beorn himself. “So here you all are still!” he  said. He picked up the hobbit and laughed: “Not  eaten up by Wargs or goblins or wicked bears  yet I see”; and he poked Mr. Baggins’ waistcoat  most disrespectfully. “Little bunny is getting nice  and fat again on bread and honey,” he  chuckled. “Come and have some more!”   So they all went to breakfast with him.  Beorn was most jolly for a change; indeed he  seemed to be in a splendidly good humour and  set them all laughing with his funny stories; nor  did they have to wonder long where he had  been or why he was so nice to them, for he told  them himself. He had been over the river and     right back up into the mountains — from which  you can guess that he could travel quickly, in  bear’s shape at any rate. From the burnt wolf-  glade he had soon found out that part of their  story was true; but he had found more than that:  he had caught a Warg and a goblin wandering  in the woods. From these he had got news: the  goblin patrols were still hunting with Wargs for  the dwarves, and they were fiercely angry  because of the death of the Great Goblin, and  also because of the burning of the chief wolfs  nose and the death from the wizard’s fire of  many of his chief servants. So much they told  him when he forced them, but he guessed there  was more wickedness than this afoot, and that  a great raid of the whole goblin army with their  wolf-allies into the lands shadowed by the  mountains might soon be made to find the  dwarves, or to take vengeance on the men and  creatures that lived there, and who they thought  must be sheltering them.   “It was a good story, that of yours,” said  Beorn, “but I like it still better now I am sure it is  true. You must forgive my not taking your word.  If you lived near the edge of Mirkwood, you  would take the word of no one that you did not  know as well as your brother or better. As it is, I  can only say that I have hurried home as fast as  I could to see that you were safe, and to offer  you any help that I can. I shall think more kindly     of dwarves after this. Killed the Great Goblin,  killed the Great Goblin!” he chuckled fiercely to  himself.   “What did you do with the goblin and the  Warg?” asked Bilbo suddenly.   “Come and see!” said Beorn, and they  followed round the house. A goblin’s head was  stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was  nailed to a tree just beyond. Beorn was a fierce  enemy. But now he was their friend, and  Gandalf thought it wise to tell him their whole  story and the reason of their journey, so that  they could get the most help he could offer.   This is what he promised to do for them. He  would provide ponies for each of them, and a  horse for Gandalf, for their journey to the forest,  and he would lade them with food to last them  for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as  easy as possible to carry — nuts, flour, sealed  jars of dried fruits, and red earthenware pots of  honey, and twice-baked cakes that would keep  good a long time, and on a little of which they  could march far. The making of these was one  of his secrets; but honey was in them, as in  most of his foods, and they were good to eat,  though they made one thirsty. Water, he said,  they would not need to carry this side of the  forest, for there were streams and springs  along the road. “But your way through Mirkwood  is dark, dangerous and difficult,” he said.     “Water is not easy to find there, nor food. The  time is not yet come for nuts (though it may be  past and gone indeed before you get to the  other side), and nuts are about all that grows  there fit for food; in there the wild things are  dark, queer, and savage. I will provide you with  skins for carrying water, and I will give you  some bows and arrows. But I doubt very much  whether anything you find in Mirkwood will be  wholesome to eat or to drink. There is one  stream there, I know, black and strong which  crosses the path. That you should neither drink  of, nor bathe in; for I have heard that it carries  enchantment and a great drowsiness and  forgetfulness. And in the dim shadows of that  place I don’t think you will shoot anything,  wholesome or unwholesome, without straying  from the path. That you MUST NOT do, for any  reason.   “That is all the advice I can give you.  Beyond the edge of the forest I cannot help you  much; you must depend on your luck and your  courage and the food I send with you. At the  gate of the forest I must ask you to send back  my horse and my ponies. But I wish you all  speed, and my house is open to you, if ever you  come back this way again.’’    They thanked him, of course, with many bows     and sweepings of their hoods and with many an  “at your service, O master of the wide wooden  halls!” But their spirits sank at his grave words,  and they all felt that the adventure was far more  dangerous than they had thought, while all the  time, even if they passed all the perils of the  road, the dragon was waiting at the end.   All that morning they were busy with  preparations. Soon after midday they ate with  Beorn for the last time, and after the meal they  mounted the steeds he was lending them, and  bidding him many farewells they rode off  through his gate at a good pace.   As soon as they left his high hedges at the  east of his fenced lands they turned north and  then bore to the north-west. By his advice they  were no longer making for the main forest-road  to the south of his land. Had they followed the  pass, their path would have led them down a  stream from the mountains that joined the great  river miles south of the Carrock. At that point  there was a deep ford which they might have  passed, if they had still had their ponies, and  beyond that a track led to the skirts of the wood  and to the entrance of the old forest road. But  Beorn had warned them that that way was now  often used by the goblins, while the forest-road  itself, he had heard, was overgrown and  disused at the eastern end and led to  impassable marshes where the paths had long     been lost. Its eastern opening had also always  been far to the south of the Lonely Mountain,  and would have left them still with a long and  difficult northward march when they got to the  other side. North of the Carrock the edge of  Mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the  Great River, and though here the Mountains too  drew down nearer, Beorn advised them to take  this way; for at a place a few days’ ride due  north of the Carrock was the gate of a little-  known pathway through Mirkwood that led  almost straight towards the Lonely Mountain.   “The goblins,” Beorn had said, “will not dare  to cross the Great River for a hundred miles  north of the Carrock nor to come near my house  — it is well protected at night! — but I should ride  fast; for if they make their raid soon they will  cross the river to the south and scour all the  edge of the forest so as to cut you off, and  Wargs run swifter than ponies. Still you are  safer going north, even though you seem to be  going back nearer to their strongholds; for that  is what they will least expect, and they will have  the longer ride to catch you. Be off now as quick  as you may!”   That is why they were now riding in silence,  galloping wherever the ground was grassy and  smooth, with the mountains dark on their left,  and in the distance the line of the river with its  trees drawing ever closer. The sun had only just     turned west when they started, and till evening it  lay golden on the land about them. It was  difficult to think of pursuing goblins behind, and  when they had put many miles between them  and Beorn’s house they began to talk and to  sing again and to forget the dark forest-path  that lay in front. But in the evening when the  dusk came on and the peaks of the mountains  glowered against the sunset they made a camp  and set a guard, and most of them slept  uneasily with dreams in which there came the  howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goblins.   Still the next morning dawned bright and fair  again. There was an autumn-like mist white  upon the ground and the air was chill, but soon  the sun rose red in the East and the mists  vanished, and while the shadows were still long  they were off again. So they rode now for two  more days, and all the while they saw nothing  save grass and flowers and birds and scattered  trees, and occasionally small herds of red deer  browsing or sitting at noon in the shade.  Sometimes Bilbo saw the horns of the harts  sticking up out of the long grass, and at first he  thought they were the dead branches of trees.  That third evening they were so eager to press  on, for Beorn had said that they should reach  the forest-gate early on the fourth-day, that they  rode still forward after dusk and into the night  beneath the moon. As the light faded Bilbo     thought he saw away to the right, or to the left,  the shadowy form of a great bear prowling  along in the same direction. But if he dared to  mention it to Gandalf, the wizard only said:  “Hush! Take no notice!”   Next day they started before dawn, though  their night had been short. As soon as it was  light they could see the forest coming as it were  to meet them, or waiting for them like a black  and frowning wall before them. The land began  to slope up and up, and it seemed to the hobbit  that a silence began to draw in upon them.  Birds began to sing less. There were no more  deer; not even rabbits were to be seen. By the  afternoon they had reached the eaves of  Mirkwood, and were resting almost beneath the  great overhanging boughs of its outer trees.  Their trunks were huge and gnarled, their  branches twisted, their leaves were dark and  long. Ivy grew on them and trailed along the  ground.   “Well, here is Mirkwood!” said Gandalf.  “The greatest of the forests of the Northern  world. I hope you like the look of it. Now you  must send back these excellent ponies you  have borrowed.”   The dwarves were inclined to grumble at  this, but the wizard told them they were fools.  “Beorn is not as far off as you seem to think,  and you had better keep your promises anyway,     for he is a bad enemy. Mr. Baggins’ eyes are  sharper than yours, if you have not seen each  night after dark a great bear going along with us  or sitting far off in the moon watching our  camps. Not only to guard you and guide you,  but to keep an eye on the ponies too. Beorn  may be your friend, but he loves his animals as  his children. You do not guess what kindness he  has shown you in letting dwarves ride them so  far and so fast, nor what would happen to you, if  you tried to take them into the forest.”   “What about the horse, then?” said Thorin.  “You don’t mention sending that back.”   “I don’t, because I am not sending it.”   “What about your promise then?”   “I will look after that. I am not sending the  horse back, I am riding it!”   Then they knew that Gandalf was going to  leave them at the very edge of Mirkwood, and  they were in despair. But nothing they could say  would change his mind.   “Now we had this all out before, when we  landed on the Carrock,” he said. “It is no use  arguing. I have, as I told you, some pressing  business away south; and I am already late  through bothering with you people. We may  meet again before all is over, and then again of  course we may not. That depends on your luck  and on your courage and sense; and I am  sending Mr. Baggins with you. I have told you     before that he has more about him than you  guess, and you will find that out before long. So  cheer up Bilbo and don’t look so glum. Cheer  up Thorin and Company! This is your expedition  after all. Think of the treasure at the end, and  forget the forest and the dragon, at any rate until  tomorrow morning!”   When tomorrow morning came he still said  the same. So now there was nothing left to do  but to fill their water-skins at a clear spring they  found close to the forest-gate, and unpack the  ponies. They distributed the packages as fairly  as they could, though Bilbo thought his lot was  wearisomely heavy, and did not at all like the  idea of trudging for miles and miles with all that  on his back.   “Don’t you worry!” said Thorin. “It will get  lighter all too soon. Before long I expect we  shall all wish our packs heavier, when the food  begins to run short.”   Then at last they said good-bye to their  ponies and turned their heads for home. Off  they trotted gaily, seeming very glad to put their  tails towards the shadow of Mirkwood. As they  went away Bilbo could have sworn that a thing  like a bear left the shadow of the trees and  shambled off quickly after them.   Now Gandalf too said farewell. Bilbo sat on  the ground feeling very unhappy and wishing he  was beside the wizard on his tall horse. He had     gone just inside the forest after breakfast (a  very poor one), and it had seemed as dark in  there in the morning as at night, and very secret:  “a sort of watching and waiting feeling,” he said  to himself.   “Good-bye!” said Gandalf to Thorin. “And  goodbye to you all, good-bye! Straight through  the forest is your way now. Don’t stray off the  track! — if you do, it is a thousand to one you will  never find it again and never get out of  Mirkwood; and then I don’t suppose I, or any  one else, will ever see you again.”   “Do we really have to go through?” groaned  the hobbit.   “Yes, you do!” said the wizard, “if you want  to get to the other side. You must either go  through or give up your quest. And I am not  going to allow you to back out now, Mr.  Baggins. I am ashamed of you for thinking of it.  You have got to look after all these dwarves for  me,” he laughed.   “No! no!” said Bilbo. “I didn’t mean that. I  meant, is there no way round?”   “There is, if you care to go two hundred  miles or so out of your way north, and twice that  south. But you wouldn’t get a safe path even  then. There are no safe paths in this part of the  world. Remember you are over the Edge of the  Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you  go. Before you could get round Mirkwood in the     North you would be right among the slopes of  the Grey Mountains, and they are simply stiff  with goblins, hobgoblins, and ores of the worst  description. Before you could get round it in the  South, you would get into the land of the  Necromancer; and even you, Bilbo, won’t need  me to tell you tales of that black sorcerer. I don’t  advise you to go anywhere near the places  overlooked by his dark tower! Stick to the  forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for the  best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you  may come out one day and see the Long  Marshes lying below you, and beyond them,  high in the East, the Lonely Mountain where  dear old Smaug lives, though I hope he is not  expecting you.”   “Very comforting you are to be sure,”  growled Thorin. “Good-bye! If you won’t come  with us, you had better get off without any more  talk!”   “Good-bye then, and really good-bye!” said  Gandalf, and he turned his horse and rode  down into the West. But he could not resist the  temptation to have the last word. Before he had  passed quite out of hearing he turned and put  his hands to his mouth and called to them. They  heard his voice come faintly: “Good-bye! Be  good, take care of yourselves — and DON’T  LEAVE THE PATH!”   Then he galloped away and was soon lost     to sight. “O good-bye and go away!” grunted the  dwarves, all the more angry because they were  really filled with dismay at losing him. Now  began the most dangerous part of all the  journey. They each shouldered the heavy pack  and the water-skin which was their share, and  turned from the light that lay on the lands  outside and plunged into the forest.      
Chapter VIII    FLIES AND SPIDERS    They walked in single file. The entrance to the  path was like a sort of arch leading into a  gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that  leant together, too old and strangled with ivy  and hung with lichen to bear more than a few  blackened leaves. The path itself was narrow  and wound in and out among the trunks. Soon  the light at the gate was like a little bright hole  far behind, and the quiet was so deep that their  feet seemed to thump along while all the trees  leaned over them and listened.   As their eyes became used to the dimness  they could see a little way to either side in a sort  of darkened green glimmer. Occasionally a  slender beam of sun that had the luck to slip in  through some opening in the leaves far above,  and still more luck in not being caught in the  tangled boughs and matted twigs beneath,  stabbed down thin and bright before them. But    this was seldom, and it soon ceased altogether.   There were black squirrels in the wood. As  Bilbo’s sharp inquisitive eyes got used to  seeing things he could catch glimpses of them  whisking off the path and scuttling behind tree-  trunks. There were queer noises too, grunts,  scufflings, and hurryings in the undergrowth, and  among the leaves that lay piled endlessly thick  in places on the forest-floor; but what made the  noises he could not see. The nastiest things  they saw were the cobwebs: dark dense  cobwebs with threads extraordinarily thick,  often stretched from tree to tree, or tangled in  the lower branches on either side of them.  There were none stretched across the path, but  whether because some magic kept it clear, or  for what other reason they could not guess.   It was not long before they grew to hate the  forest as heartily as they had hated the tunnels  of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less  hope of any ending. But they had to go on and  on, long after they were sick for a sight of the  sun and of the sky, and longed for the feel of  wind on their faces. There was no movement of  air down under the forest-roof, and it was  everlastingly still and dark and stuffy. Even the  dwarves felt it, who were used to tunnelling, and  lived at times for long whiles without the light of  the sun; but the hobbit, who liked holes to make     a house in but not to spend summer days in, felt  that he was being slowly suffocated.   The nights were the worst. It then became  pitch-dark — not what you call pitch-dark, but  really pitch: so black that you really could see  nothing. Bilbo tried flapping his hand in front of  his nose, but he could not see it at all. Well,  perhaps it is not true to say that they could see  nothing: they could see eyes. They slept all  closely huddled together, and took it in turns to  watch; and when it was Bilbo’s turn he would  see gleams in the darkness round them, and  sometimes pairs of yellow or red or green eyes  would stare at him from a little distance, and  then slowly fade and disappear and slowly  shine out again in another place. And  sometimes they would gleam down from the  branches just above him; and that was most  terrifying. But the eyes that he liked the least  were horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes. “Insect  eyes,” he thought, “not animal eyes, only they  are much too big.”   Although it was not yet very cold, they tried  lighting watch-fires at night, but they soon gave  that up. It seemed to bring hundreds and  hundreds of eyes all round them, though the  creatures, whatever they were, were careful  never to let their bodies show in the little flicker  of the flames. Worse still it brought thousands of     dark-grey and black moths, some nearly as big  as your hand, flapping and whirring round their  ears. They could not stand that, nor the huge  bats, black as a top-hat, either; so they gave up  fires and sat at night and dozed in the  enormous uncanny darkness.   All this went on for what seemed to the  hobbit ages upon ages; and he was always  hungry, for they were extremely careful with their  provisions. Even so, as days followed days,  and still the forest seemed just the same, they  began to get anxious. The food would not last  for ever: it was in fact already beginning to get  low. They tried shooting at the squirrels, and  they wasted many arrows before they managed  to bring one down on the path. But when they  roasted it, it proved horrible to taste, and they  shot no more squirrels.   They were thirsty too, for they had none too  much water, and in all the time they had seen  neither spring nor stream. This was their state  when one day they found their path blocked by  a running water. It flowed fast and strong but not  very wide right across the way, and it was  black, or looked it in the gloom. It was well that  Beorn had warned them against it, or they  would have drunk from it, whatever its colour,  and filled some of their emptied skins at its  bank. As it was they only thought of how to     cross it without wetting themselves in its water.  There had been a bridge of wood across, but it  had rotted and fallen leaving only the broken  posts near the bank.   Bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering  forward cried: “There is a boat against the far  bank! Now why couldn’t it have been this side!”   “How far away do you think it is?” asked  Thorin, for by now they knew Bilbo had the  sharpest eyes among them.   "Not at all far. I shouldn’t think above twelve  yards.”   “Twelve yards! I should have thought it was  thirty at least, but my eyes don’t see as well as  they used a hundred years ago. Still twelve  yards is as good as a mile. We can’t jump it,  and we daren’t try to wade or swim.”   “Can any of you throw a rope?”   “What’s the good of that? The boat is sure  to be tied up, even if we could hook it, which I  doubt.”   “I don’t believe it is tied,” said Bilbo, “though  of course I can’t be sure in this light; but it looks  to me as if it was just drawn up on the bank,  which is low just there where the path goes  down into the water.”   “Dori is the strongest, but Fili is the  youngest and still has the best sight,” said  Thorin. “Come here Fili, and see if you can see     the boat Mr. Baggins is talking about.”   Fili thought he could; so when he had stared  a long while to get an idea of the direction, the  others brought him a rope. They had several  with them, and on the end of the longest they  fastened one of the large iron hooks they had  used for catching their packs to the straps  about their shoulders. Fili took this in his hand,  balanced it for a moment, and then flung it  across the stream.   Splash it fell in the water! “Not far enough!”  said Bilbo who was peering forward. “A couple  of feet and you would have dropped it on to the  boat. Try again. I don’t suppose the magic is  strong enough to hurt you, if you just touch a bit  of wet rope.”   Fili picked up the hook when he had drawn  it back, rather doubtfully all the same. This time  he threw it with great strength.   “Steady!” said Bilbo, “you have thrown it  right into the wood on the other side now. Draw  it back gently.” Fili hauled the rope back slowly,  and after a while Bilbo said: “Carefully! It is lying  on the boat; let’s hope the hook will catch.”   It did. The rope went taut, and Fili pulled in  vain. Kili came to his help, and then Oin and  Gloin. They tugged and tugged, and suddenly  they all fell over on their backs. Bilbo was on the  look out, however, caught the rope, and with a     piece of stick fended off the little black boat as  it came rushing across the stream. “Help!” he  shouted, and Balin was just in time to seize the  boat before it floated off down the current.   “It was tied after all,” said he, looking at the  snapped painter that was still dangling from it.  “That was a good pull, my lads; and a good job  that our rope was the stronger.”   “Who’ll cross first?” asked Bilbo.   “I shall,” said Thorin, “and you will come with  me, and Fili and Balin. That’s as many as the  boat will hold at a time. After that Kili and Oin  and Gloin and Dori; next Ori and Nori, Bifur and  Bofur; and last Dwalin and Bombur.”   “I’m always last and I don’t like it,” said  Bombur. “It’s somebody else’s turn today.”   “You should not be so fat. As you are, you  must be with the last and lightest boatload.  Don’t start grumbling against orders, or  something bad will happen to you.”   “There aren’t any oars. How are you going  to push the boat back to the far bank?” asked  the hobbit.   “Give me another length of rope and  another hook,” said Fili, and when they had got  it ready, he cast it into the darkness ahead and  as high as he could throw it. Since it did not fall  down again, they saw that it must have stuck in  the branches. “Get in now,” said Fili, “and one     of you haul on the rope that is stuck in a tree on  the other side. One of the others must keep  hold of the hook we used at first, and when we  are safe on the other side he can hook it on,  and you can draw the boat back.”   In this way they were all soon on the far  bank safe across the enchanted stream. Dwalin  had just scrambled out with the coiled rope on  his arm, and Bombur (still grumbling) was  getting ready to follow, when something bad did  happen. There was a flying sound of hooves on  the path ahead. Out of the gloom came  suddenly the shape of a flying deer, it charged  into the dwarves and bowled them over, then  gathered itself for a leap. High it sprang and  cleared the water with a mighty jump. But it did  not reach the other side in safety. Thorin was  the only one who had kept his feet and his wits.  As soon as they had landed he had bent his  bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden  guardian of the boat appeared. Now he sent a  swift and sure shot into the leaping beast. As it  reached the further bank it stumbled. The  shadows swallowed it up, but they heard the  sound of hooves quickly falter and then go still.   Before they could shout in praise of the  shot, however, a dreadful wail from Bilbo put all  thoughts of venison out of their minds. “Bombur  has fallen in! Bombur is drowning!” he cried. It     was only too true. Bombur had only one foot on  the land when the hart bore down on him, and  sprang over him. He had stumbled, thrusting the  boat away from the bank, and then toppled  back into the dark water, his hands slipping off  the slimy roots at the edge, while the boat span  slowly off and disappeared.   They could still see his hood above the  water when they ran to the bank. Quickly, they  flung a rope with a hook towards him. His hand  caught it, and they pulled him to the shore. He  was drenched from hair to boots, of course, but  that was not the worst. When they laid him on  the bank he was already fast asleep, with one  hand clutching the rope so tight that they could  not get it from his grasp; and fast asleep he  remained in spite of all they could do.   They were still standing over him, cursing  their ill luck, and Bombur’s clumsiness, and  lamenting the loss of the boat which made it  impossible for them to go back and look for the  hart, when they became aware of the dim  blowing of horns in the wood and the sound as  of dogs baying far off. Then they all fell silent;  and as they sat it seemed they could hear the  noise of a great hunt going by to the north of the  path, though they saw no sign of it.   There they sat for a long while and did not  dare to make a move. Bombur slept on with a     smile on his fat face, as if he no longer cared  for all the troubles that vexed them. Suddenly on  the path ahead appeared some white deer, a  hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had  been dark. They glimmered in the shadows.  Before Thorin could cry out three of the dwarves  had leaped to their feet and loosed off arrows  from their bows. None seemed to find their  mark. The deer turned and vanished in the trees  as silently as they had come, and in vain the  dwarves shot their arrows after them.   “Stop! stop!” shouted Thorin; but it was too  late, the excited dwarves had wasted their last  arrows, and now the bows that Beorn had given  them were useless.   They were a gloomy party that night, and the  gloom gathered still deeper on them in the  following days. They had crossed the  enchanted stream; but beyond it the path  seemed to straggle on just as before, and in the  forest they could see no change. Yet if they had  known more about it and considered the  meaning of the hunt and the white deer that had  appeared upon their path, they would have  known that they were at last drawing towards  the eastern edge, and would soon have come,  if they could have kept up their courage and  their hope, to thinner trees and places where  the sunlight came again.     But they did not know this, and they were  burdened with the heavy body of Bombur, which  they had to carry along with them as best they  could, taking the wearisome task in turns of four  each while the others shared their packs. If  these had not become all too light in the last few  days, they would never have managed it; but a  slumbering and smiling Bombur was a poor  exchange for packs filled with food however  heavy. In a few days a time came when there  was practically nothing left to eat or to drink.  Nothing wholesome could they see growing in  the wood, only funguses and herbs with pale  leaves and unpleasant smell.   About four days from the enchanted stream  they came to a part where most of the trees  were beeches. They were at first inclined to be  cheered by the change, for here there was no  undergrowth and the shadow was not so deep.  There was a greenish light about them, and in  places they could see some distance to either  side of the path. Yet the light only showed them  endless lines of straight grey trunks like the  pillars of some huge twilight hall. There was a  breath of air and a noise of wind, but it had a  sad sound. A few leaves came rustling down to  remind them that outside autumn was coming  on. Their feet ruffled among the dead leaves of  countless other autumns that drifted over the     banks of the path from the deep red carpets of  the forest.   Still Bombur slept and they grew very  weary. At times they heard disquieting laughter.  Sometimes there was singing in the distance  too. The laughter was the laughter of fair voices  not of goblins, and the singing was beautiful, but  it sounded eerie and strange, and they were not  comforted, rather they hurried on from those  parts with what strength they had left.   Two days later they found their path going  downwards, and before long they were in a  valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth  of oaks.   “Is there no end to this accursed forest?”  said Thorin. “Somebody must climb a tree and  see if he can get his head above the roof and  have a look round. The only way is to choose  the tallest tree that overhangs the path.”   Of course “somebody” meant Bilbo. They  chose him, because to be of any use the  climber must get his head above the topmost  leaves, and so he must be light enough for the  highest and slenderest branches to bear him.  Poor Mr. Baggins had never had much practice  in climbing trees, but they hoisted him up into  the lowest branches of an enormous oak that  grew right out into the path, and up he had to go  as best he could. He pushed his way through     the tangled twigs with many a slap in the eye;  he was greened and grimed from the old bark  of the greater boughs; more than once he  slipped and caught himself just in time; and at  last, after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place  where there seemed to be no convenient  branches at all, he got near the top. All the time  he was wondering whether there were spiders  in the tree, and how he was going to get down  again (except by falling).   In the end he poked his head above the roof  of leaves, and then he found spiders all right.  But they were only small ones of ordinary size,  and they were after the butterflies. Bilbo’s eyes  were nearly blinded by the light. He could hear  the dwarves shouting up at him from far below,  but he could not answer, only hold on and blink.  The sun was shining brilliantly, and it was a long  while before he could bear it. When he could,  he saw all round him a sea of dark green,  ruffled here and there by the breeze; and there  were everywhere hundreds of butterflies. I  expect they were a kind of “purple emperor”, a  butterfly that loves the tops of oak-woods, but  these were not purple at all, they were a dark  dark velvety black without any markings to be  seen.   He looked at the “black emperors” for a  long time, and enjoyed the feel of the breeze in     his hair and on his face; but at length the cries  of the dwarves, who were now simply stamping  with impatience down below, reminded him of  his real business. It was no good. Gaze as  much as he might, he could see no end to the  trees and the leaves in any direction. His heart,  that had been lightened by the sight of the sun  and the feel of the wind, sank back into his toes:  there was no food to go back to down below.   Actually, as I have told you, they were not far  off the edge of the forest; and if Bilbo had had  the sense to see it, the tree that he had  climbed, though it was tall in itself, was standing  near the bottom of a wide valley, so that from its  top the trees seemed to swell up all round like  the edges of a great bowl, and he could not  expect to see how far the forest lasted. Still he  did not see this, and he climbed down full of  despair. He got to the bottom again at last,  scratched, hot, and miserable, and he could not  see anything in the gloom below when he got  there. His report soon made the others as  miserable as he was.   “The forest goes on for ever and ever and  ever in all directions! Whatever shall we do?  And what is the use of sending a hobbit!" they  cried, as if it was his fault. They did not care  tuppence about the butterflies, and were only  made more angry when he told them of the     beautiful breeze, which they were too heavy to  climb up and feel.    That night they ate their very last scraps and  crumbs of food; and next morning when they  woke the first thing they noticed was that they  were still gnawingly hungry, and the next thing  was that it was raining and that here and there  the drip of it was dropping heavily on the forest  floor. That only reminded them that they were  also parchingly thirsty, without doing anything to  relieve them: you cannot quench a terrible thirst  by standing under giant oaks and waiting for a  chance drip to fall on your tongue. The only  scrap of comfort there was came unexpectedly  from Bombur.   He woke up suddenly and sat up scratching  his head. He could not make out where he was  at all, nor why he felt so hungry; for he had  forgotten everything that had happened since  they started their journey that May morning long  ago. The last thing that he remembered was the  party at the hobbit’s house, and they had great  difficulty in making him believe their tale of all  the many adventures they had had since.   When he heard that there was nothing to  eat, he sat down and wept, for he felt very weak     and wobbly in the legs. “Why ever did I wake  up!” he cried. “I was having such beautiful  dreams. I dreamed I was walking in a forest  rather like this one, only lit with torches on the  trees and lamps swinging from the branches  and fires burning on the ground; and there was  a great feast going on, going on for ever. A  woodland king was there with a crown of  leaves, and there was a merry singing, and I  could not count or describe the things there  were to eat and drink.”   “You need not try,” said Thorin. “In fact if you  can’t talk about something else, you had better  be silent. We are quite annoyed enough with  you as it is. If you hadn’t waked up, we should  have left you to your idiotic dreams in the forest;  you are no joke to carry even after weeks of  short commons.”   There was nothing now to be done but to  tighten the belts round their empty stomachs,  and hoist their empty sacks and packs, and  trudge along the track without any great hope of  ever getting to the end before they lay down and  died of starvation. This they did all that day,  going very slowly and wearily; while Bombur  kept on wailing that his legs would not carry him  and that he wanted to lie down and sleep.   “No you don’t!” they said. “Let your legs  take their share, we have carried you far     enough.”   All the same he suddenly refused to go a  step further and flung himself on the ground. “Go  on, if you must,” he said. “I’m just going to lie  here and sleep and dream of food, if I can’t get  it any other way. I hope I never wake up again.”   At that very moment Balin, who was a little  way ahead, called out: “What was that? I  thought I saw a twinkle of light in the forest.”   They all looked, and a longish way off, it  seemed, they saw a red twinkle in the dark;  then another and another sprang out beside it.  Even Bombur got up, and they hurried along  then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. The  light was in front of them and to the left of the  path, and when at last they had drawn level with  it, it seemed plain that torches and fires were  burning under the trees, but a good way off their  track.   “It looks as if my dreams were coming true,”  gasped Bombur puffing up behind. He wanted  to rush straight off into the wood after the lights.  But the others remembered only too well the  warnings of the wizard and of Beorn.   “A feast would be no good, if we never got  back alive from it,” said Thorin.   “But without a feast we shan’t remain alive  much longer anyway,” said Bombur, and Bilbo  heartily agreed with him. They argued about it     backwards and forwards for a long while, until  they agreed at length to send out a couple of  spies, to creep near the lights and find out more  about them. But then they could not agree on  who was to be sent: no one seemed anxious to  run the chance of being lost and never finding  his friends again. In the end, in spite of  warnings, hunger decided them, because  Bombur kept on describing all the good things  that were being eaten, according to his dream,  in the woodland feast; so they all left the path  and plunged into the forest together.   After a good deal of creeping and crawling  they peered round the trunks and looked into a  clearing where some trees had been felled and  the ground levelled. There were many people  there, elvish-looking folk, all dressed in green  and brown and sitting on sawn rings of the  felled trees in a great circle. There was a fire in  their midst and there were torches fastened to  some of the trees round about; but most  splendid sight of all: they were eating and  drinking and laughing merrily.   The smell of the roast meats was so  enchanting that, without waiting to consult one  another, every one of them got up and  scrambled forwards into the ring with the one  idea of begging for some food. No sooner had  the first stepped into the clearing than all the     lights went out as if by magic. Somebody  kicked the fire and it went up in rockets of  glittering sparks and vanished. They were lost  in a completely lightless dark and they could not  even find one another, not for a long time at any  rate. After blundering frantically in the gloom,  falling over logs, bumping crash into trees, and  shouting and calling till they must have waked  everything in the forest for miles, at last they  managed to gather themselves in a bundle and  count themselves by touch. By that time they  had, of course, quite forgotten in what direction  the path lay, and they were all hopelessly lost, at  least till morning.   There was nothing for it but to settle down  for the night where they were; they did not even  dare to search on the ground for scraps of food  for fear of becoming separated again. But they  had not been lying long, and Bilbo was only just  getting drowsy, when Dori, whose turn it was to  watch first, said in a loud whisper:   “The lights are coming out again over there,  and there are more than ever of them.”   Up they all jumped. There, sure enough, not  far away were scores of twinkling lights, and  they heard the voices and the laughter quite  plainly. They crept slowly towards them, in a  single line, each touching the back of the one in  front. When they got near Thorin said: “No     rushing forward this time! No one is to stir from  hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone  first to talk to them. They won’t be frightened of  him — (‘What about me of them?’ thought Bilbo)  — and any way I hope they won’t do anything  nasty to him.”   When they got to the edge of the circle of  lights they pushed Bilbo suddenly from behind.  Before he had time to slip on his ring, he  stumbled forward into the full blaze of the fire  and torches. It was no good. Out went all the  lights again and complete darkness fell.   If it had been difficult collecting themselves  before, it was far worse this time. And they  simply could not find the hobbit. Every time they  counted themselves it only made thirteen. They  shouted and called: “Bilbo Baggins! Hobbit!  You dratted hobbit! Hi! hobbit, confusticate you,  where are you?” and other things of that sort,  but there was no answer.   They were just giving up hope, when Dori  stumbled across him by sheer luck. In the dark  he fell over what he thought was a log, and he  found it was the hobbit curled up fast asleep. It  took a deal of shaking to wake him, and when  he was awake he was not pleased at all.   “I was having such a lovely dream,” he  grumbled, “all about having a most gorgeous  dinner.”     “Good heavens! he has gone like Bombur,”  they said. “Don’t tell us about dreams. Dream-  dinners aren’t any good, and we can’t share  them.”   “They are the best I am likely to get in this  beastly place,” he muttered, as he lay down  beside the dwarves and tried to go back to  sleep and find his dream again.   But that was not the last of the lights in the  forest. Later when the night must have been  getting old, Kili who was watching then, came  and roused them all again, saying:   “There’s a regular blaze of light begun not  far away — hundreds of torches and many fires  must have been lit suddenly and by magic. And  hark to the singing and the harps!”   After lying and listening for a while, they  found they could not resist the desire to go  nearer and try once more to get help. Up they  got again; and this time the result was  disastrous. The feast that they now saw was  greater and more magnificent than before; and  at the head of a long line of feasters sat a  woodland king with a crown of leaves upon his  golden hair, very much as Bombur had  described the figure in his dream. The elvish  folk were passing bowls from hand to hand and  across the fires, and some were harping and  many were singing. Their gleaming hair was     twined with flowers; green and white gems  glinted on their collars and their belts; and their  faces and their songs were filled with mirth.  Loud and clear and fair were those songs, and  out stepped Thorin in to their midst.   Dead silence fell in the middle of a word.  Out went all light. The fires leaped up in black  smokes. Ashes and cinders were in the eyes of  the dwarves, and the wood was filled again with  their clamour and their cries.   Bilbo found himself running round and round  (as he thought) and calling and calling: “Dori,  Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Fili, Kili, Bombur, Bifur,  Bofur, Dwalin, Balin, Thorin Oakenshield,” while  people he could not see or feel were doing the  same all round him (with an occasional “Bilbo!”  thrown in). But the cries of the others got  steadily further and fainter, and though after a  while it seemed to him they changed to yells  and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at  last died right away, and he was left alone in  complete silence and darkness.    That was one of his most miserable moments.  But he soon made up his mind that it was no  good trying to do anything till day came with  some little light, and quite useless to go     blundering about tiring himself out with no hope  of any breakfast to revive him. So he sat himself  down with his back to a tree, and not for the last  time fell to thinking of his far-distant hobbit-hole  with its beautiful pantries. He was deep in  thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and  butter when he felt something touch him.  Something like a strong sticky string was  against his left hand, and when he tried to move  he found that his legs were already wrapped in  the same stuff, so that when he got up he fell  over.   Then the great spider, who had been busy  tying him up while he dozed, came from behind  him and came at him. He could only see the  thing’s eyes, but he could feel its hairy legs as it  struggled to wind its abominable threads round  and round him. It was lucky that he had come to  his senses in time. Soon he would not have  been able to move at all. As it was, he had a  desperate fight before he got free. He beat the  creature off with his hands — it was trying to  poison him to keep him quiet, as small spiders  do to flies — until he remembered his sword and  drew it out. Then the spider jumped back, and  he had time to cut his legs loose. After that it  was his turn to attack. The spider evidently was  not used to things that carried such stings at  their sides, or it would have hurried away     quicker. Bilbo came at it before it could  disappear and stuck it with his sword right in  the eyes. Then it went mad and leaped and  danced and flung out its legs in horrible jerks,  until he killed it with another stroke; and then he  fell down and remembered nothing more for a  long while.   There was the usual dim grey light of the  forest-day about him when he came to his  senses. The spider lay dead beside him, and  his sword-blade was stained black. Somehow  the killing of the giant spider, all alone by  himself in the dark without the help of the wizard  or the dwarves or of anyone else, made a great  difference to Mr. Baggins. He felt a different  person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of  an empty stomach, as he wiped his sword on  the grass and put it back into its sheath.   “I will give you a name,” he said to it, “and I  shall call you Sting.”   After that he set out to explore. The forest  was grim and silent, but obviously he had first of  all to look for his friends, who were not likely to  be very far off, unless they had been made  prisoners by the elves (or worse things). Bilbo  felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a  long while wondering in what direction the path  lay, and in what direction he should go first to  look for the dwarves.     “O! why did we not remember Beorn’s  advice, and Gandalfs!” he lamented. “What a  mess we are in now! We! I only wish it was i/ie:  it is horrible being all alone.”   In the end he made as good a guess as he  could at the direction from which the cries for  help had come in the night — and by luck (he  was born with a good share of it) he guessed  more or less right, as you will see. Having made  up his mind he crept along as cleverly as he  could. Hobbits are clever at quietness,  especially in woods, as I have already told you;  also Bilbo had slipped on his ring before he  started. That is why the spiders neither saw nor  heard him coming.   He had picked his way stealthily for some  distance, when he noticed a place of dense  black shadow ahead of him, black even for that  forest, like a patch of midnight that had never  been cleared away. As he drew nearer, he saw  that it was made by spider-webs one behind  and over and tangled with another. Suddenly he  saw, too, that there were spiders huge and  horrible sitting in the branches above him, and  ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they  should discover him. Standing behind a tree he  watched a group of them for some time, and  then in the silence and stillness of the wood he  realised that these loathsome creatures were     speaking one to another. Their voices were a  sort of thin creaking and hissing, but he could  make out many of the words that they said.  They were talking about the dwarves!   “It was a sharp struggle, but worth it,” said  one. “What nasty thick skins they have to be  sure, but I'll wager there is good juice inside.”   “Aye, they’ll make fine eating, when they’ve  hung a bit,” said another.   “Don’t hang ’em too long,” said a third.  “They’re not as fat as they might be. Been  feeding none too well of late, I should guess.”   “Kill ’em, I say,” hissed a fourth; “kill ’em  now and hang ’em dead for a while.”   “They’re dead now, I’ll warrant,” said the  first.   “That they are not. I saw one a-struggling  just now. Just coming round again, I should say,  after a bee-autiful sleep. I’ll show you.”   With that one of the fat spiders ran along a  rope till it came to a dozen bundles hanging in a  row from a high branch. Bilbo was horrified,  now that he noticed them for the first time  dangling in the shadows, to see a dwarvish foot  sticking out of the bottoms of some of the  bundles, or here and there the tip of a nose, or  a bit of beard or of a hood.   To the fattest of these bundles the spider  went — “It is poor old Bombur, I’ll bet,” thought     Bilbo — and nipped hard at the nose that stuck  out. There was a muffled yelp inside, and a toe  shot up and kicked the spider straight and hard.  There was life in Bombur still. There was a  noise like the kicking of a flabby football, and  the enraged spider fell off the branch, only  catching itself with its own thread just in time.   The others laughed. “You were quite right,”  they said, “the meat’s alive and kicking!”   “I’ll soon put an end to that,” hissed the  angry spider climbing back onto the branch.    Bilbo saw that the moment had come when he  must do something. He could not get up at the  brutes and he had nothing to shoot with; but  looking about he saw that in this place there  were many stones lying in what appeared to be  a now dry little watercourse. Bilbo was a pretty  fair shot with a stone, and it did not take him  long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that  fitted his hand cosily. As a boy he used to  practise throwing stones at things, until rabbits  and squirrels, and even birds, got out of his way  as quick as lightning if they saw him stoop; and  even grownup he had still spent a deal of his  time at quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at the  wand, bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of     the aiming and throwing sort — indeed he could  do lots of things, besides blowing smoke-rings,  asking riddles and cooking, that I haven’t had  time to tell you about. There is no time now.  While he was picking up stones, the spider had  reached Bombur, and soon he would have  been dead. At that moment Bilbo threw. The  stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it  dropped senseless off the tree, flop to the  ground, with all its legs curled up.   The next stone went whizzing through a big  web, snapping its cords, and taking off the  spider sitting in the middle of it, whack, dead.  After that there was a deal of commotion in the  spider-colony, and they forgot the dwarves for a  bit, I can tell you. They could not see Bilbo, but  they could make a good guess at the direction  from which the stones were coming. As quick  as lightning they came running and swinging  towards the hobbit, flinging out their long  threads in all directions, till the air seemed full of  waving snares.   Bilbo, however, soon slipped away to a  different place. The idea came to him to lead  the furious spiders further and further away from  the dwarves, if he could; to make them curious,  excited and angry all at once. When about fifty  had gone off to the place where he had stood  before, he threw some more stones at these,     and at others that had stopped behind; then  dancing among the trees he began to sing a  song to infuriate them and bring them all after  him, and also to let the dwarves hear his voice.   This is what he sang:    Old fat spider spinning in a tree!   Old fat spider cant see me!  Attercop! Attercop!   Wont you stop,   Stop your spinning and look forme?    Old Tomnoddy, all big body,   Old Tomnoddy cant spy me!  Attercop! Attercop!   Down you drop!   Youll never catch me up your tree!    Not very good perhaps, but then you must  remember that he had to make it up himself, on  the spur of a very awkward moment. It did what  he wanted any way. As he sang he threw some  more stones and stamped. Practically all the  spiders in the place came after him: some     dropped to the ground, others raced along the  branches, swung from tree to tree, or cast new  ropes across the dark spaces. They made for  his noise far quicker than he had expected.  They were frightfully angry. Quite apart from the  stones no spider has ever liked being called  Attercop, and Tomnoddy of course is insulting  to anybody.   Off Bilbo scuttled to a fresh place, but  several of the spiders had run now to different  points in the glade where they lived, and were  busy spinning webs across all the spaces  between the tree-stems. Very soon the hobbit  would be caught in a thick fence of them all  round him — that at least was the spiders’ idea.  Standing now in the middle of the hunting and  spinning insects Bilbo plucked up his courage  and began a new song:    Lazy Lob and crazy Cob  are weaving webs to wind me.   I am far more sweet than other meat,  but still they cannot find me!    Here am I, naughty little fly;     you are fat and lazy.   You cannot trap me, though you try,  in your cobwebs crazy.    With that he turned and found that the last  space between two tall trees had been closed  with a web — but luckily not a proper web, only  great strands of double-thick spider-rope run  hastily backwards and forwards from trunk to  trunk. Out came his little sword. He slashed the  threads to pieces and went off singing.   The spiders saw the sword, though I don’t  suppose they knew what it was, and at once the  whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit  along the ground and the branches, hairy legs  waving, nippers and spinners snapping, eyes  popping, full of froth and rage. They followed  him into the forest until Bilbo had gone as far as  he dared. Then quieter than a mouse he stole  back.   He had precious little time, he knew, before  the spiders were disgusted and came back to  their trees where the dwarves were hung. In the  meanwhile he had to rescue them. The worst  part of the job was getting up on to the long  branch where the bundles were dangling. I don’t  suppose he would have managed it, if a spider  had not luckily left a rope hanging down; with its     help, though it stuck to his hand and hurt him, he  scrambled up — only to meet an old slow wicked  fat-bodied spider who had remained behind to  guard the prisoners, and had been busy  pinching them to see which was the juiciest to  eat. it had thought of starting the feast while the  others were away, but Mr. Baggins was in a  hurry, and before the spider knew what was  happening it felt his sting and rolled off the  branch dead.   Bilbo’s next job was to loose a dwarf. What  was he to do? If he cut the string which hung  him up, the wretched dwarf would tumble thump  to the ground a good way below. Wriggling  along the branch (which made all the poor  dwarves dance and dangle like ripe fruit) he  reached the first bundle.   “Fili or Kili,” he thought by the tip of a blue  hood sticking out at the top. “Most likely Fili," he  thought by the tip of a long nose poking out of  the winding threads. He managed by leaning  over to cut most of the strong sticky threads that  bound him round, and then, sure enough, with a  kick and a struggle most of Fili emerged. I am  afraid Bilbo actually laughed at the sight of him  jerking his stiff arms and legs as he danced on  the spider-string under his armpits, just like one  of those funny toys bobbing on a wire.   Somehow or other Fili was got on to the     branch, and then he did his best to help the  hobbit, although he was feeling very sick and ill  from spider-poison, and from hanging most of  the night and the next day wound round and  round with only his nose to breathe through. It  took him ages to get the beastly stuff out of his  eyes and eyebrows, and as for his beard, he  had to cut most of it off. Well, between them  they started to haul up first one dwarf and then  another and slash them free. None of them  were better off than Fili, and some of them were  worse. Some had hardly been able to breathe  at all (long noses are sometimes useful you  see) and some had been more poisoned.   In this way they rescued Kili, Bifur, Bofur,  Dori and Nori. Poor old Bombur was so  exhausted — he was the fattest and had been  constantly pinched and poked — that he just  rolled off the branch and fell plop on to the  ground, fortunately on to leaves, and lay there.  But there were still five dwarves hanging at the  end of the branch when the spiders began to  come back, more full of rage than ever.   Bilbo immediately went to the end of the  branch nearest the tree-trunk and kept back  those that crawled up. He had taken off his ring  when he rescued Fili and forgotten to put it on  again, so now they all began to splutter and  hiss:     “Now we see you, you nasty little creature!  We will eat you and leave your bones and skin  hanging on a tree. Ugh! he’s got a sting has  he? Well, we’ll get him all the same, and then  we’ll hang him head downwards for a day or  two.”   While this was going on, the other dwarves  were working at the rest of the captives, and  cutting at the threads with their knives. Soon all  would be free, though it was not clear what  would happen after that. The spiders had  caught them pretty easily the night before, but  that had been unawares and in the dark. This  time there looked like being a horrible battle.   Suddenly Bilbo noticed that some of the  spiders had gathered round old Bombur on the  floor, and had tied him up again and were  dragging him away. He gave a shout and  slashed at the spiders in front of him. They  quickly gave way, and he scrambled and fell  down the tree right into the middle of those on  the ground. His little sword was something new  in the way of stings for them. How it darted to  and fro! It shone with delight as he stabbed at  them. Half a dozen were killed before the rest  drew off and left Bombur to Bilbo.   “Come down! Come down!” he shouted to  the dwarves on the branch. “Don’t stay up there  and be netted!” For he saw spiders swarming     up all the neighbouring trees, and crawling  along the boughs above the heads of the  dwarves.   Down the dwarves scrambled or jumped or  dropped, eleven all in a heap, most of them very  shaky and little use on their legs. There they  were at last, twelve of them counting poor old  Bombur, who was being propped up on either  side by his cousin Bifur, and his brother Bofur;  and Bilbo was dancing about and waving his  Sting; and hundreds of angry spiders were  goggling at them all round and about and  above. It looked pretty hopeless.   Then the battle began. Some of the  dwarves had knives, and some had sticks, and  all of them could get at stones; and Bilbo had  his elvish dagger. Again and again the spiders  were beaten off, and many of them were killed.  But it could not go on for long. Bilbo was nearly  tired out; only four of the dwarves were able to  stand firmly, and soon they would all be  overpowered like weary flies. Already the  spiders were beginning to weave their webs all  round them again from tree to tree.   In the end Bilbo could think of no plan  except to let the dwarves into the secret of his  ring. He was rather sorry about it, but it could  not be helped.   “I am going to disappear,” he said. “I shall     draw the spiders off, if I can; and you must keep  together and make in the opposite direction. To  the left there, that is more or less the way  towards the place where we last saw the elf-  fires.”   It was difficult to get them to understand,  what with their dizzy heads, and the shouts, and  the whacking of sticks and the throwing of  stones; but at last Bilbo felt he could delay no  longer — the spiders were drawing their circle  ever closer. He suddenly slipped on his ring,  and to the great astonishment of the dwarves  he vanished.   Soon there came the sound of “Lazy Lob”  and “Attercop” from among the trees away on  the right. That upset the spiders greatly. They  stopped advancing, and some went off in the  direction of the voice. “Attercop” made them so  angry that they lost their wits. Then Balin, who  had grasped Bilbo’s plan better than the rest,  led an attack. The dwarves huddled together in  a knot, and sending a shower of stones they  drove at the spiders on the left, and burst  through the ring. Away behind them now the  shouting and singing suddenly stopped.   Hoping desperately that Bilbo had not been  caught the dwarves went on. Not fast enough,  though. They were sick and weary, and they  could not go much better than a hobble and a     wobble, though many of the spiders were close  behind. Every now and then they had to turn and  fight the creatures that were overtaking them;  and already some spiders were in the trees  above them and throwing down their long  clinging threads.   Things were looking pretty bad again, when  suddenly Bilbo reappeared, and charged into  the astonished spiders unexpectedly from the  side.   “Go on! Go on!” he shouted. “I will do the  stinging!”   And he did. He darted backwards and  forwards, slashing at spider-threads, hacking at  their legs, and stabbing at their fat bodies if  they came too near. The spiders swelled with  rage, and spluttered and frothed, and hissed  out horrible curses; but they had become  mortally afraid of Sting, and dared not come  very near, now that it had come back. So curse  as they would, their prey moved slowly but  steadily away. It was a most terrible business,  and seemed to take hours. But at last, just when  Bilbo felt that he could not lift his hand for a  single stroke more, the spiders suddenly gave it  up, and followed them no more, but went back  disappointed to their dark colony.   The dwarves then noticed that they had  come to the edge of a ring where elf-fires had     been. Whether it was one of those they had  seen the night before, they could not tell. But it  seemed that some good magic lingered in such  spots, which the spiders did not like. At any rate  here the light was greener, and the boughs less  thick and threatening, and they had a chance to  rest and draw breath.   There they lay for some time, puffing and  panting. But very soon they began to ask  questions. They had to have the whole  vanishing business carefully explained, and the  finding of the ring interested them so much that  for a while they forgot their own troubles. Balin  in particular insisted on having the Gollum story,  riddles and all, told all over again, with the ring  in its proper place. But after a time the light  began to fail, and then other questions were  asked. Where were they, and where was their  path, and where was there any food, and what  were they going to do next? These questions  they asked over and over again, and it was  from little Bilbo that they seemed to expect to  get the answers. From which you can see that  they had changed their opinion of Mr. Baggins  very much, and had begun to have a great  respect for him (as Gandalf had said they  would). Indeed they really expected him to think  of some wonderful plan for helping them, and  were not merely grumbling. They knew only too     well that they would soon all have been dead, if  it had not been for the hobbit; and they thanked  him many times. Some of them even got up and  bowed right to the ground before him, though  they fell over with the effort, and could not get on  their legs again for some time. Knowing the  truth about the vanishing did not lessen their  opinion of Bilbo at all; for they saw that he had  some wits, as well as luck and a magic ring —  and all three are very useful possessions. In fact  they praised him so much that Bilbo began to  feel there really was something of a bold  adventurer about himself after all, though he  would have felt a lot bolder still, if there had  been anything to eat.   But there was nothing, nothing at all; and  none of them were fit to go and look for  anything, or to search for the lost path. The lost  path! No other idea would come into Bilbo’s  tired head. He just sat staring in front of him at  the endless trees; and after a while they all fell  silent again. All except Balin. Long after the  others had stopped talking and shut their eyes,  he kept on muttering and chuckling to himself.   “Gollum! Well I’m blest! So that’s how he  sneaked past me, is it? Now I know! Just crept  quietly along did you, Mr. Baggins? Buttons all  over the doorstep! Good old Bilbo — Bilbo —  Bilbo — bo — bo — bo — ” And then he fell asleep,     and there was complete silence for a long  while.   All of a sudden Dwalin opened an eye, and  looked round at them. “Where is Thorin?” he  asked.   It was a terrible shock. Of course there were  only thirteen of them, twelve dwarves and the  hobbit. Where indeed was Thorin? They  wondered what evil fate had befallen him,  magic or dark monsters; and shuddered as  they lay lost in the forest. There they dropped off  one by one into uncomfortable sleep full of  horrible dreams, as evening wore to black  night; and there we must leave them for the  present, too sick and weary to set guards or to  take turns at watching.   Thorin had been caught much faster than  they had. You remember Bilbo falling like a log  into sleep, as he stepped into a circle of light?  The next time it had been Thorin who stepped  forward, and as the lights went out he fell like a  stone enchanted. All the noise of the dwarves  lost in the night, their cries as the spiders  caught them and bound them, and all the  sounds of the battle next day, had passed over  him unheard. Then the Wood-elves had come  to him, and bound him, and carried him away.   The feasting people were Wood-elves, of  course. These are not wicked folk. If they have a     fault it is distrust of strangers. Though their  magic was strong, even in those days they were  wary. They differed from the High Elves of the  West, and were more dangerous and less wise.  For most of them (together with their scattered  relations in the hills and mountains) were  descended from the ancient tribes that never  went to Faerie in the West. There the Light-  elves and the Deep-elves and the Sea-elves  went and lived for ages, and grew fairer and  wiser and more learned, and invented their  magic and their cunning craft in the making of  beautiful and marvellous things, before some  came back into the Wide World. In the Wide  World the Wood-elves lingered in the twilight of  our Sun and Moon, but loved best the stars; and  they wandered in the great forests that grew tall  in lands that are now lost. They dwelt most often  by the edges of the woods, from which they  could escape at times to hunt, or to ride and run  over the open lands by moonlight or starlight;  and after the coming of Men they took ever  more and more to the gloaming and the dusk.  Still elves they were and remain, and that is  Good People.   In a great cave some miles within the edge  of Mirkwood on its eastern side there lived at  this time their greatest king. Before his huge  doors of stone a river ran out of the heights of     the forest and flowed on and out into the  marshes at the feet of the high wooded lands.  This great cave, from which countless smaller  ones opened out on every side, wound far  underground and had many passages and wide  halls; but it was lighter and more wholesome  than any goblin-dwelling, and neither so deep  nor so dangerous. In fact the subjects of the  king mostly lived and hunted in the open woods,  and had houses or huts on the ground and in  the branches. The beeches were their favourite  trees. The king’s cave was his palace, and the  strong place of his treasure, and the fortress of  his people against their enemies.   It was also the dungeon of his prisoners. So  to the cave they dragged Thorin — not too gently,  for they did not love dwarves, and thought he  was an enemy. In ancient days they had had  wars with some of the dwarves, whom they  accused of stealing their treasure. It is only fair  to say that the dwarves gave a different  account, and said that they only took what was  their due, for the elf-king had bargained with  them to shape his raw gold and silver, and had  afterwards refused to give them their pay. If the  elf-king had a weakness it was for treasure,  especially for silver and white gems; and though  his hoard was rich, he was ever eager for more,  since he had not yet as great a treasure as     other elf-lords of old. His people neither mined  nor worked metals or jewels, nor did they bother  much with trade or with tilling the earth. All this  was well known to every dwarf, though Thorin’s  family had had nothing to do with the old quarrel  I have spoken of. Consequently Thorin was  angry at their treatment of him, when they took  their spell off him and he came to his senses;  and also he was determined that no word of  gold or jewels should be dragged out of him.   The king looked sternly on Thorin, when he  was brought before him, and asked him many  questions. But Thorin would only say that he  was starving.   “Why did you and your folk three times try to  attack my people at their merrymaking?” asked  the king.   “We did not attack them,” answered Thorin;  “we came to beg, because we were starving.”   “Where are your friends now, and what are  they doing?”   “I don’t know, but I expect starving in the  forest.”   “What were you doing in the forest?”   “Looking for food and drink, because we  were starving.”   “But what brought you into the forest at all?”  asked the king angrily.   At that Thorin shut his mouth and would not     say another word.   “Very well!” said the king. “Take him away  and keep him safe, until he feels inclined to tell  the truth, even if he waits a hundred years.”   Then the elves put thongs on him, and shut  him in one of the inmost caves with strong  wooden doors, and left him. They gave him  food and drink, plenty of both, if not very fine; for  Wood-elves were not goblins, and were  reasonably well-behaved even to their worst  enemies, when they captured them. The giant  spiders were the only living things that they had  no mercy upon.   There in the king’s dungeon poor Thorin lay;  and after he had got over his thankfulness for  bread and meat and water, he began to wonder  what had become of his unfortunate friends. It  was not very long before he discovered; but that  belongs to the next 
chapter and the beginning  of another adventure in which the hobbit again  showed his usefulness.      
Chapter IX    BARRELS OUT OF BOND    The day after the battle with the spiders Bilbo  and the dwarves made one last despairing  effort to find a way out before they died of  hunger and thirst. They got up and staggered on  in the direction which eight out of the thirteen of  them guessed to be the one in which the path  lay; but they never found out if they were right.  Such day as there ever was in the forest was  fading once more into the blackness of night,  when suddenly out sprang the light of many  torches all round them, like hundreds of red  stars. Out leaped Wood-elves with their bows  and spears and called the dwarves to halt.   There was no thought of a fight. Even if the  dwarves had not been in such a state that they  were actually glad to be captured, their small  knives, the only weapons they had, would have  been of no use against the arrows of the elves  that could hit a bird's eye in the dark. So they  simply stopped dead and sat down and waited  — all except Bilbo, who popped on his ring and    slipped quickly to one side. That is why, when  the elves bound the dwarves in a long line, one  behind the other, and counted them, they never  found or counted the hobbit.   Nor did they hear or feel him trotting along  well behind their torch-light as they led off their  prisoners into the forest. Each dwarf was  blindfold, but that did not make much difference,  for even Bilbo with the use of his eyes could not  see where they were going, and neither he nor  the others knew where they had started from  anyway. Bilbo had all he could do to keep up  with the torches, for the elves were making the  dwarves go as fast as ever they could, sick and  weary as they were. The king had ordered them  to make haste. Suddenly the torches stopped,  and the hobbit had just time to catch them up  before they began to cross the bridge. This was  the bridge that led across the river to the king’s  doors. The water flowed dark and swift and  strong beneath; and at the far end were gates  before the mouth of a huge cave that ran into  the side of a steep slope covered with trees.  There the great beeches came right down to  the bank, till their feet were in the stream.   Across the bridge the elves thrust their  prisoners, but Bilbo hesitated in the rear. He  did not at all like the look of the cavern-mouth,  and he only made up his mind not to desert his  friends just in time to scuttle over at the heels of  the last elves, before the great gates of the king     closed behind them with a clang.   Inside the passages were lit with red torch-  light, and the elf-guards sang as they marched  along the twisting, crossing, and echoing paths.  These were not like those of the goblin-cities;  they were smaller, less deep underground, and  filled with a cleaner air. In a great hall with pillars  hewn out of the living stone sat the Elvenking on  a chair of carven wood. On his head was a  crown of berries and red leaves, for the autumn  was come again. In the spring he wore a crown  of woodland flowers. In his hand he held a  carven staff of oak.      The Elvenking's Gate.   The prisoners were brought before him; and  though he looked grimly at them, he told his  men to unbind them, for they were ragged and  weary. “Besides they need no ropes in here,”  said he. “There is no escape from my magic  doors for those who are once brought inside.”   Long and searchingly he questioned the  dwarves about their doings, and where they  were going to, and where they were coming  from; but he got little more news out of them  than out of Thorin. They were surly and angry  and did not even pretend to be polite.     “What have we done, O king?” said Balin,  who was the eldest left. “Is it a crime to be lost  in the forest, to be hungry and thirsty, to be  trapped by spiders? Are the spiders your tame  beasts or your pets, if killing them makes you  angry?”   Such a question of course made the king  angrier than ever, and he answered: “It is a  crime to wander in my realm without leave. Do  you forget that you were in my kingdom, using  the road that my people made? Did you not  three times pursue and trouble my people in the  forest and rouse the spiders with your riot and  clamour? After all the disturbance you have  made I have a right to know what brings you  here, and if you will not tell me now, I will keep  you all in prison until you have learned sense  and manners!”   Then he ordered the dwarves each to be  put in a separate cell and to be given food and  drink, but not to be allowed to pass the doors of  their little prisons, until one at least of them was  willing to tell him all he wanted to know. But he  did not tell them that Thorin was also a prisoner  with him. It was Bilbo who found that out.    Poor Mr. Baggins — it was a weary long time  that he lived in that place all alone, and always  in hiding, never daring to take off his ring, hardly     daring to sleep, even tucked away in the  darkest and remotest corners he could find. For  something to do he took to wandering about the  Elvenking's palace. Magic shut the gates, but  he could sometimes get out, if he was quick.  Companies of the Wood-elves, sometimes with  the king at their head, would from time to time  ride out to hunt, or to other business in the  woods and in the lands to the East. Then if  Bilbo was very nimble, he could slip out just  behind them; though it was a dangerous thing to  do. More than once he was nearly caught in the  doors, as they clashed together when the last  elf passed; yet he did not dare to march among  them because of his shadow (altogether thin  and wobbly as it was in torchlight), or for fear of  being bumped into and discovered. And when  he did go out, which was not very often, he did  no good. Fie did not wish to desert the dwarves,  and indeed he did not know where in the world  to go without them. He could not keep up with  the hunting elves all the time they were out, so  he never discovered the ways out of the wood,  and was left to wander miserably in the forest,  terrified of losing himself, until a chance came  of returning. He was hungry too outside, for he  was no hunter; but inside the caves he could  pick up a living of some sort by stealing food  from store or table when no one was at hand.   “I am like a burglar that can’t get away, but  must go on miserably burgling the same house     day after day,” he thought. “This is the dreariest  and dullest part of all this wretched, tiresome,  uncomfortable adventure! I wish I was back in  my hobbit-hole by my own warm fireside with  the lamp shining!” He often wished, too, that he  could get a message for help sent to the wizard,  but that of course was quite impossible; and he  soon realized that if anything was to be done, it  would have to be done by Mr. Baggins, alone  and unaided.   Eventually, after a week or two of this  sneaking sort of life, by watching and following  the guards and taking what chances he could,  he managed to find out where each dwarf was  kept. He found all their twelve cells in different  parts of the palace, and after a time he got to  know his way about very well. What was his  surprise one day to overhear some of the  guards talking and to learn that there was  another dwarf in prison too, in a specially deep  dark place. He guessed at once, of course, that  that was Thorin; and after a while he found that  his guess was right. At last after many  difficulties he managed to find the place when  no one was about, and to have a word with the  chief of the dwarves.   Thorin was too wretched to be angry any  longer at his misfortunes, and was even  beginning to think of telling the king all about his  treasure and his quest (which shows how low-  spirited he had become), when he heard     Bilbo’s little voice at his keyhole. He could  hardly believe his ears. Soon however he made  up his mind that he could not be mistaken, and  he came to the door and had a long whispered  talk with the hobbit on the other side.   So it was that Bilbo was able to take  secretly Thorin's message to each of the other  imprisoned dwarves, telling them that Thorin  their chief was also in prison close at hand, and  that no one was to reveal their errand to the  king, not yet, nor before Thorin gave the word.  For Thorin had taken heart again hearing how  the hobbit had rescued his companions from  the spiders, and was determined once more  not to ransom himself with promises to the king  of a share in the treasure, until all hope of  escaping in any other way had disappeared;  until in fact the remarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins  (of whom he began to have a very high opinion  indeed) had altogether failed to think of  something clever.   The other dwarves quite agreed when they  got the message. They all thought their own  shares in the treasure (which they quite  regarded as theirs, in spite of their plight and  the still unconquered dragon) would suffer  seriously if the Wood-elves claimed part of it,  and they all trusted Bilbo. Just what Gandalf had  said would happen, you see. Perhaps that was  part of his reason for going off and leaving  them.     Bilbo, however, did not feel nearly so  hopeful as they did. He did not like being  depended on by everyone, and he wished he  had the wizard at hand. But that was no use:  probably all the dark distance of Mirkwood lay  between them. He sat and thought and thought,  until his head nearly burst, but no bright idea  would come. One invisible ring was a very fine  thing, but it was not much good among fourteen.  But of course, as you have guessed, he did  rescue his friends in the end, and this is how it  happened.   One day, nosing and wandering about,  Bilbo discovered a very interesting thing: the  great gates were not the only entrance to the  caves. A stream flowed under part of the lowest  regions of the palace, and joined the Forest  River some way further to the east, beyond the  steep slope out of which the main mouth  opened. Where this underground watercourse  came forth from the hillside there was a water-  gate. There the rocky roof came down close to  the surface of the stream, and from it a  portcullis could be dropped right to the bed of  the river to prevent anyone coming in or out that  way. But the portcullis was often open, for a  good deal of traffic went out and in by the water-  gate. If anyone had come in that way, he would  have found himself in a dark rough tunnel  leading deep into the heart of the hill; but at one  point where it passed under the caves the roof     had been cut away and covered with great  oaken trapdoors. These opened upwards into  the king’s cellars. There stood barrels, and  barrels, and barrels; for the Wood-elves, and  especially their king, were very fond of wine,  though no vines grew in those parts. The wine,  and other goods, were brought from far away,  from their kinsfolk in the South, or from the  vineyards of Men in distant lands.   Hiding behind one of the largest barrels  Bilbo discovered the trapdoors and their use,  and lurking there, listening to the talk of the  king's servants, he learned how the wine and  other goods came up the rivers, or over land, to  the Long Lake. It seemed a town of Men still  throve there, built out on bridges far into the  water as a protection against enemies of all  sorts, and especially against the dragon of the  Mountain. From Lake-town the barrels were  brought up the Forest River. Often they were  just tied together like big rafts and poled or  rowed up the stream; sometimes they were  loaded on to flat boats.   When the barrels were empty the elves cast  them through the trapdoors, opened the water-  gate, and out the barrels floated on the stream,  bobbing along, until they were carried by the  current to a place far down the river where the  bank jutted out, near to the very eastern edge of  Mirkwood. There they were collected and tied  together and floated back to Lake-town, which     stood close to the point where the Forest River  flowed into the Long Lake.    For some time Bilbo sat and thought about this  water-gate, and wondered if it could be used for  the escape of his friends, and at last he had the  desperate beginnings of a plan.   The evening meal had been taken to the  prisoners. The guards were tramping away  down the passages taking the torchlight with  them and leaving everything in darkness. Then  Bilbo heard the king's butler bidding the chief of  the guards good-night.   “Now come with me,” he said, “and taste  the new wine that has just come in. I shall be  hard at work tonight clearing the cellars of the  empty wood, so let us have a drink first to help  the labour.”   “Very good,” laughed the chief of the  guards. “I’ll taste with you, and see if it is fit for  the king’s table. There is a feast tonight and it  would not do to send up poor stuff!”    When he heard this Bilbo was all in a flutter, for  he saw that luck was with him and he had a  chance at once to try his desperate plan. Fie  followed the two elves, until they entered a small  cellar and sat down at a table on which two     large flagons were set. Soon they began to  drink and laugh merrily. Luck of an unusual kind  was with Bilbo then. It must be potent wine to  make a wood-elf drowsy; but this wine, it would  seem, was the heady vintage of the great  gardens of Dorwinion, not meant for his  soldiers or his servants, but for the king's feasts  only, and for smaller bowls not for the butler’s  great flagons.   Very soon the chief guard nodded his head,  then he laid it on the table and fell fast asleep.  The butler went on talking and laughing to  himself for a while without seeming to notice,  but soon his head too nodded to the table, and  he fell asleep and snored beside his friend.  Then in crept the hobbit. Very soon the chief  guard had no keys, but Bilbo was trotting as  fast as he could along the passages towards  the cells. The great bunch seemed very heavy  to his arms, and his heart was often in his  mouth, in spite of his ring, for he could not  prevent the keys from making every now and  then a loud clink and clank, which put him all in  a tremble.   First he unlocked Balin’s door, and locked it  again carefully as soon as the dwarf was  outside. Balin was most surprised, as you can  imagine; but glad as he was to get out of his  wearisome little stone room, he wanted to stop  and ask questions, and know what Bilbo was  going to do, and all about it.     “No time now!” said the hobbit. “You just  follow me! We must all keep together and not  risk getting separated. All of us must escape or  none, and this is our last chance. If this is found  out, goodness knows where the king will put you  next, with chains on your hands and feet too, I  expect. Don't argue, there’s a good fellow!”   Then off he went from door to door, until his  following had grown to twelve — none of them  any too nimble, what with the dark, and what  with their long imprisonment. Bilbo’s heart  thumped every time one of them bumped into  another, or grunted or whispered in the dark.  “Drat this dwarvish racket!” he said to himself.  But all went well, and they met no guards. As a  matter of fact there was a great autumn feast in  the woods that night, and in the halls above.  Nearly all the king’s folk were merrymaking.   At last after much blundering they came to  Thorin’s dungeon, far down in a deep place and  fortunately not far from the cellars.   “Upon my word!” said Thorin, when Bilbo  whispered to him to come out and join his  friends, “Gandalf spoke true, as usual! A pretty  fine burglar you make, it seems, when the time  comes. I am sure we are all for ever at your  service, whatever happens after this. But what  comes next?”   Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain  his idea, as far as he could; but he did not feel  at all sure how the dwarves would take it. His     fears were quite justified, for they did not like it  a bit, and started grumbling loudly in spite of  their danger.   “We shall be bruised and battered to  pieces, and drowned too, for certain!” they  muttered. “We thought you had got some  sensible notion, when you managed to get hold  of the keys. This is a mad idea!”   “Very well!” said Bilbo very downcast, and  also rather annoyed. “Come along back to your  nice cells, and I will lock you all in again, and  you can sit there comfortably and think of a  better plan — but I don't suppose I shall ever get  hold of the keys again, even if I feel inclined to  try.”   That was too much for them, and they  calmed down. In the end, of course, they had to  do just what Bilbo suggested, because it was  obviously impossible for them to try and find  their way into the upper halls, or to fight their  way out of gates that closed by magic; and it  was no good grumbling in the passages until  they were caught again. So following the hobbit,  down into the lowest cellars they crept. They  passed a door through which the chief guard  and the butler could be seen still happily snoring  with smiles upon their faces. The wine of  Dorwinion brings deep and pleasant dreams.  There would be a different expression on the  face of the chief guard next day, even though  Bilbo, before they went on, stole in and kind-     heartedly put the keys back on his belt.   “That will save him some of the trouble he is  in for,” said Mr. Baggins to himself. “He wasn’t  a bad fellow, and quite decent to the prisoners.  It will puzzle them all too. They will think we had  a very strong magic to pass through all those  locked doors and disappear. Disappear! We  have got to get busy very quick, if that is to  happen!”    Balin was told off to watch the guard and the  butler and give warning if they stirred. The rest  went into the adjoining cellar with the trapdoors.  There was little time to lose. Before long, as  Bilbo knew, some elves were under orders to  come down and help the butler get the empty  barrels through the doors into the stream.  These were in fact already standing in rows in  the middle of the floor waiting to be pushed off.  Some of them were wine-barrels, and these  were not much use, as they could not easily be  opened at the end without a deal of noise, nor  could they easily be secured again. But among  them were several others, which had been used  for bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all  sorts of things, to the king’s palace.   They soon found thirteen with room enough  for a dwarf in each. In fact some were too  roomy, and as they climbed in the dwarves     thought anxiously of the shaking and the  bumping they would get inside, though Bilbo did  his best to find straw and other stuff to pack  them in as cosily as could be managed in a  short time. At last twelve dwarves were stowed.  Thorin had given a lot of trouble, and turned and  twisted in his tub and grumbled like a large dog  in a small kennel; while Balin, who came last,  made a great fuss about his air-holes and said  he was stifling, even before his lid was on. Bilbo  had done what he could to close holes in the  sides of the barrels, and to fix on all the lids as  safely as could be managed, and now he was  left alone again, running round putting the  finishing touches to the packing, and hoping  against hope that his plan would come off.   It had not been done a bit too soon. Only a  minute or two after Balin's lid had been fitted on  there came the sound of voices and the flicker  of lights. A number of elves came laughing and  talking into the cellars and singing snatches of  song. They had left a merry feast in one of the  halls and were bent on returning as soon as  they could.   “Where’s old Galion, the butler?” said one.  “I haven’t seen him at the tables tonight. He  ought to be here now to show us what is to be  done.”   “I shall be angry if the old slowcoach is late,”  said another. “I have no wish to waste time  down here while the song is up!”     "Ha, ha!” came a cry. “Here's the old villain  with his head on a jug! He's been having a little  feast all to himself and his friend the captain.”   “Shake him! Wake him!” shouted the others  impatiently.   Galion was not at all pleased at being  shaken or wakened, and still less at being  laughed at. “You’re all late,” he grumbled. “Here  am I waiting and waiting down here, while you  fellows drink and make merry and forget your  tasks. Small wonder if I fall asleep from  weariness!”   “Small wonder,” said they, “when the  explanation stands close at hand in a jug!  Come give us a taste of your sleeping-draught  before we fall to! No need to wake the turnkey  yonder. He has had his share by the looks of it.”   Then they drank once round and became  mighty merry all of a sudden. But they did not  quite lose their wits. “Save us, Galion!” cried  some, “you began your feasting early and  muddled your wits! You have stacked some full  casks here instead of the empty ones, if there is  anything in weight.”   “Get on with the work!” growled the butler.  “There is nothing in the feeling of weight in an  idle toss-pot's arms. These are the ones to go  and no others. Do as I say!”   “Very well, very well,” they answered rolling  the barrels to the opening. “On your head be it,  if the king’s full buttertubs and his best wine is     pushed into the river for the Lake-men to feast  on for nothing!”    Roll — roll — roll — roll,  roll -roll -rolling down the hole!  Heave ho! Splash plump!   Down they go, down they bump!    So they sang as first one barrel and then  another rumbled to the dark opening and was  pushed over into the cold water some feet  below. Some were barrels really empty, some  were tubs neatly packed with a dwarf each; but  down they all went, one after another, with many  a clash and a bump, thudding on top of ones  below, smacking into the water, jostling against  the walls of the tunnel, knocking into one  another, and bobbing away down the current.   It was just at this moment that Bilbo  suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan.  Most likely you saw it some time ago and have  been laughing at him; but I don’t suppose you  would have done half as well yourselves in his  place. Of course he was not in a barrel himself,  nor was there anyone to pack him in, even if  there had been a chance! It looked as if he  would certainly lose his friends this time (nearly  all of them had already disappeared through the  dark trap-door), and get utterly left behind and     have to stay lurking as a permanent burglar in  the elf-caves for ever. For even if he could have  escaped through the upper gates at once, he  had precious small chance of ever finding the  dwarves again. He did not know the way by  land to the place where the barrels were  collected. He wondered what on earth would  happen to them without him; for he had not had  time to tell the dwarves all that he had learned,  or what he had meant to do, once they were out  of the wood.   While all these thoughts were passing  through his mind, the elves being very merry  began to sing a song round the river-door.  Some had already gone to haul on the ropes  which pulled up the portcullis at the water-gate  so as to let out the barrels as soon as they were  all afloat below.    Down the swift dark stream you go  Back to lands you once did know/.  Leave the halls and caverns deep,  Leave the northern mountains steep,  Where the forest wide and dim  Stoops in shadow grey and grim!  Float beyond the world of trees  Out into the whispering breeze,   Past the rushes, past the reeds,   Past the marsh’s waving weeds,  Through the mist that riseth white     Up from mere and pool at night!  Follovy follow stars that leap  Up the heavens cold and steep;  Turn when dawn comes overland,  Over rapid, over sand,   South away! and South away!  Seek the sunlight and the day,  Back to pasture, back to mead,  Where the kine and oxen feed!  Back to gardens on the hills  Where the berry swells and fills  Under sunlight, under day!   South away! and South away!  Down the swift dark stream you go  Back to lands you once did know/.    Now the very last barrel was being rolled to  the doors! In despair and not knowing what else  to do, poor little Bilbo caught hold of it and was  pushed over the edge with it. Down into the  water he fell, splash! into the cold dark water  with the barrel on top of him.   He came up again spluttering and clinging  to the wood like a rat, but for all his efforts he  could not scramble on top. Every time he tried,  the barrel rolled round and ducked him under  again. It was really empty, and floated light as a  cork. Though his ears were full of water, he  could hear the elves still singing in the cellar  above. Then suddenly the trap-doors fell to with     a boom and their voices faded away. He was in  the dark tunnel floating in icy water, all alone —  for you cannot count friends that are all packed  up in barrels.   Very soon a grey patch came in the  darkness ahead. He heard the creak of the  water-gate being hauled up, and he found that  he was in the midst of a bobbing and bumping  mass of casks and tubs all pressing together to  pass under the arch and get out into the open  stream. He had as much as he could do to  prevent himself from being hustled and battered  to bits; but at last the jostling crowd began to  break up and swing off, one by one, under the  stony arch and away Then he saw that it would  have been no good even if he had managed to  get astride his barrel, for there was no room to  spare, not even for a hobbit, between its top  and the suddenly stooping roof where the gate  was.    Out they went under the overhanging branches  of the trees on either bank. Bilbo wondered  what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot  of water was getting into their tubs. Some of  those that bobbed along by him in the gloom  seemed pretty low in the water, and he guessed  that these had dwarves inside.   “I do hope I put the lids on tight enough!” he     thought, but before long he was worrying too  much about himself to remember the dwarves.  He managed to keep his head above the water,  but he was shivering with the cold, and he  wondered if he would die of it before the luck  turned, and how much longer he would be able  to hang on, and whether he should risk the  chance of letting go and trying to swim to the  bank.   The luck turned all right before long: the  eddying current carried several barrels close  ashore at one point and there for a while they  stuck against some hidden root. Then Bilbo  took the opportunity of scrambling up the side  of his barrel while it was held steady against  another. Up he crawled like a drowned rat, and  lay on the top spread out to keep the balance  as best he could. The breeze was cold but  better than the water, and he hoped he would  not suddenly roll off again when they started off  once more.   Before long the barrels broke free again  and turned and twisted off down the stream,  and out into the main current. Then he found it  quite as difficult to stick on as he had feared;  but he managed it somehow, though it was  miserably uncomfortable. Luckily he was very  light, and the barrel was a good big one and  being rather leaky had now shipped a small  amount of water. All the same it was like trying  to ride, without bridle or stirrups, a round-bellied     pony that was always thinking of rolling on the  grass.   In this way at last Mr. Baggins came to a  place where the trees on either hand grew  thinner. He could see the paler sky between  them. The dark river opened suddenly wide,  and there it was joined to the main water of the  Forest River flowing down in haste from the  king's great doors. There was a dim sheet of  water no longer overshadowed, and on its  sliding surface there were dancing and broken  reflections of clouds and of stars. Then the  hurrying water of the Forest River swept all the  company of casks and tubs away to the north  bank, in which it had eaten out a wide bay. This  had a shingly shore under hanging banks and  was walled at the eastern end by a little jutting  cape of hard rock. On the shallow shore most of  the barrels ran aground, though a few went on  to bump against the stony pier.   There were people on the look-out on the  banks. They quickly poled and pushed all the  barrels together into the shallows, and when  they had counted them they roped them  together and left them till the morning. Poor  dwarves! Bilbo was not badly off now. He  slipped from his barrel and waded ashore, and  then sneaked along to some huts that he could  see near the water’s edge. He no longer  thought twice about picking up a supper  uninvited if he got the chance, he had been     obliged to do it for so long, and he knew now  only too well what it was to be really hungry, not  merely politely interested in the dainties of a  well-filled larder. Also he had caught a glimpse  of a fire through the trees, and that appealed to  him with his dripping and ragged clothes  clinging to him cold and clammy.    There is no need to tell you much of his  adventures that night, for now we are drawing  near the end of the eastward journey and  coming to the last and greatest adventure, so  we must hurry on. Of course helped by his  magic ring he got on very well at first, but he  was given away in the end by his wet footsteps  and the trail of drippings that he left wherever he  went or sat; and also he began to snivel, and  wherever he tried to hide he was found out by  the terrific explosions of his suppressed  sneezes. Very soon there was a fine  commotion in the village by the riverside; but  Bilbo escaped into the woods carrying a loaf  and a leather bottle of wine and a pie that did  not belong to him. The rest of the night he had  to pass wet as he was and far from a fire, but  the bottle helped him to do that, and he actually  dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though  the yearwas getting late and the airwas chilly.   He woke again with a specially loud     sneeze. It was already grey morning, and there  was a merry racket down by the river. They  were making up a raft of barrels, and the raft-  elves would soon be steering it off down the  stream to Lake-town. Bilbo sneezed again. He  was no longer dripping but he felt cold all over.  He scrambled down as fast as his stiff legs  would take him and managed just in time to get  on to the mass of casks without being noticed  in the general bustle. Luckily there was no sun  at the time to cast an awkward shadow, and for  a mercy he did not sneeze again for a good  while.   There was a mighty pushing of poles. The  elves that were standing in the shallow water  heaved and shoved. The barrels now all lashed  together creaked and fretted.   “This is a heavy load!” some grumbled.  “They float too deep — some of these are never  empty. If they had come ashore in the daylight,  we might have had a look inside,” they said.   “No time now!” cried the raftman. “Shove  off!” And off they went at last, slowly at first, until  they had passed the point of rock where other  elves stood to fend them off with poles, and  then quicker and quicker as they caught the  main stream and went sailing away down, down  towards the Lake.   They had escaped the dungeons of the king  and were through the wood, but whether alive or  dead still remains to be seen.       
Chapter X    A WARM WELCOME    The day grew lighter and warmer as they  floated along. After a while the river rounded a  steep shoulder of land that came down upon  their left. Under its rocky feet like an inland cliff  the deepest stream had flowed lapping and  bubbling. Suddenly the cliff fell away. The  shores sank. The trees ended. Then Bilbo saw  a sight:   The lands opened wide about him, filled  with the waters of the river which broke up and  wandered in a hundred winding courses, or  halted in marshes and pools dotted with isles  on every side; but still a strong water flowed on  steadily through the midst. And far away, its  dark head in a torn cloud, there loomed the  Mountain! Its nearest neighbours to the North-  East and the tumbled land that joined it to them  could not be seen. All alone it rose and looked  across the marshes to the forest. The Lonely    Mountain! Bilbo had come far and through  many adventures to see it, and now he did not  like the look of it in the least.   As he listened to the talk of the raftmen and  pieced together the scraps of information they  let fall, he soon realized that he was very  fortunate ever to have seen it at all, even from  this distance. Dreary as had been his  imprisonment and unpleasant as was his  position (to say nothing of the poor dwarves  underneath him) still, he had been more lucky  than he had guessed. The talk was all of the  trade that came and went on the waterways and  the growth of the traffic on the river, as the  roads out of the East towards Mirkwood  vanished or fell into disuse; and of the  bickerings of the Lake-men and the Wood-  elves about the upkeep of the Forest River and  the care of the banks. Those lands had  changed much since the days when dwarves  dwelt in the Mountain, days which most people  now remembered only as a very shadowy  tradition. They had changed even in recent  years, and since the last news that Gandalf had  had of them. Great floods and rains had swollen  the waters that flowed east; and there had been  an earthquake or two (which some were  inclined to attribute to the dragon — alluding to  him chiefly with a curse and an ominous nod in     the direction of the Mountain). The marshes and  bogs had spread wider and wider on either  side. Paths had vanished, and many a rider and  wanderer too, if they had tried to find the lost  ways across. The elf-road through the wood  which the dwarves had followed on the advice  of Beorn now came to a doubtful and little used  end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the  river offered any longer a safe way from the  skirts of Mirkwood in the North to the mountain-  shadowed plains beyond, and the river was  guarded by the Wood-elves’ king.   So you see Bilbo had come in the end by  the only road that was any good. It might have  been some comfort to Mr. Baggins shivering on  the barrels, if he had known that news of this  had reached Gandalf far away and given him  great anxiety, and that he was in fact finishing  his other business (which does not come into  this tale) and getting ready to come in search of  Thorin’s company. But Bilbo did not know it.   All he knew was that the river seemed to go  on and on and on for ever, and he was hungry,  and had a nasty cold in the nose, and did not  like the way the Mountain seemed to frown at  him and threaten him as it drew ever nearer.  After a while, however, the river took a more  southerly course and the Mountain receded  again, and at last, late in the day the shores     grew rocky, the river gathered all its wandering  waters together into a deep and rapid flood,  and they swept along at great speed.   The sun had set when turning with another  sweep towards the East the forest-river rushed  into the Long Lake. There it had a wide mouth  with stony clifflike gates at either side whose  feet were piled with shingles. The Long Lake!  Bilbo had never imagined that any water that  was not the sea could look so big. It was so  wide that the opposite shores looked small and  far, but it was so long that its northerly end,  which pointed towards the Mountain, could not  be seen at all. Only from the map did Bilbo  know that away up there, where the stars of the  Wain were already twinkling, the Running River  came down into the lake from Dale and with the  Forest River filled with deep waters what must  once have been a great deep rocky valley. At  the southern end the doubled waters poured out  again over high waterfalls and ran away  hurriedly to unknown lands. In the still evening  air the noise of the falls could be heard like a  distant roar.   Not far from the mouth of the Forest River  was the strange town he heard the elves speak  of in the king’s cellars. It was not built on the  shore, though there were a few huts and  buildings there, but right out on the surface of     the lake, protected from the swirl of the entering  river by a promontory of rock which formed a  calm bay. A great bridge made of wood ran out  to where on huge piles made of forest trees  was built a busy wooden town, not a town of  elves but of Men, who still dared to dwell here  under the shadow of the distant dragon-  mountain. They still throve on the trade that  came up the great river from the South and was  carted past the falls to their town; but in the  great days of old, when Dale in the North was  rich and prosperous, they had been wealthy and  powerful, and there had been fleets of boats on  the waters, and some were filled with gold and  some with warriors in armour, and there had  been wars and deeds which were now only a  legend. The rotting piles of a greater town could  still be seen along the shores when the waters  sank in a drought.   But men remembered little of all that, though  some still sang old songs of the dwarf-kings of  the Mountain, Thror and Thrain of the race of  Durin, and of the coming of the Dragon, and the  fall of the lords of Dale. Some sang too that  Thror and Thrain would come back one day and  gold would flow in rivers, through the mountain-  gates, and all that land would be filled with new  song and new laughter. But this pleasant legend  did not much affect their daily business.       As soon as the raft of barrels came in sight  boats rowed out from the piles of the town, and  voices hailed the raft-steerers. Then ropes were  cast and oars were pulled, and soon the raft  was drawn out of the current of the Forest River  and towed away round the high shoulder of rock  into the little bay of Lake-town. There it was  moored not far from the shoreward head of the  great bridge. Soon men would come up from  the South and take some of the casks away,  and others they would fill with goods they had  brought to be taken back up the stream to the  Wood-elves’ home. In the meanwhile the  barrels were left afloat while the elves of the raft  and the boatmen went to feast in Lake-town.   They would have been surprised, if they  could have seen what happened down by the  shore, after they had gone and the shades of  night had fallen. First of all a barrel was cut  loose by Bilbo and pushed to the shore and  opened. Groans came from inside, and out  crept a most unhappy dwarf. Wet straw was in  his draggled beard; he was so sore and stiff, so  bruised and buffeted he could hardly stand or    stumble through the shallow water to lie  groaning on the shore. He had a famished and  a savage look like a dog that has been chained  and forgotten in a kennel for a week. It was  Thorin, but you could only have told it by his  golden chain, and by the colour of his now dirty  and tattered sky-blue hood with its tarnished  silver tassel. It was some time before he would  be even polite to the hobbit.   “Well, are you alive or are you dead?”  asked Bilbo quite crossly. Perhaps he had  forgotten that he had had at least one good  meal more than the dwarves, and also the use  of his arms and legs, not to speak of a greater  allowance of air. “Are you still in prison, or are  you free? If you want food, and if you want to go  on with this silly adventure — it’s yours after all  and not mine — you had better slap your arms  and rub your legs and try and help me get the  others out while there is a chance!”   Thorin of course saw the sense of this, so  after a few more groans he got up and helped  the hobbit as well as he could. In the darkness  floundering in the cold water they had a difficult  and very nasty job finding which were the right  barrels. Knocking outside and calling only  discovered about six dwarves that could  answer. These were unpacked and helped  ashore where they sat or lay muttering and     moaning; they were so soaked and bruised and  cramped that they could hardly yet realize their  release or be properly thankful for it.   Dwalin and Balin were two of the most  unhappy, and it was no good asking them to  help. Bifur and Bofur were less knocked about  and drier, but they lay down and would do  nothing. Fili and Kili, however, who were young  (for dwarves) and had also been packed more  neatly with plenty of straw into smaller casks,  came out more or less smiling, with only a  bruise or two and a stiffness that soon wore off.   “I hope I never smell the smell of apples  again!” said Fili. “My tub was full of it. To smell  apples everlastingly when you can scarcely  move and are cold and sick with hunger is  maddening. I could eat anything in the wide  world now, for hours on end — but not an apple!”   With the willing help of Fili and Kili, Thorin  and Bilbo at last discovered the remainder of  the company and got them out. Poor fat  Bombur was asleep or senseless; Dori, Nori,  Ori, Oin and Gloin were waterlogged and  seemed only half alive; they all had to be  carried one by one and laid helpless on the  shore.   “Well! Here we are!” said Thorin. “And I  suppose we ought to thank our stars and Mr.  Baggins. I am sure he has a right to expect it,     though I wish he could have arranged a more  comfortable journey. Still — all very much at your  service once more, Mr. Baggins. No doubt we  shall feel properly grateful, when we are fed and  recovered. In the meanwhile what next?”   “I suggest Lake-town,” said Bilbo. “What  else is there?”   Nothing else could, of course, be  suggested; so leaving the others Thorin and Fili  and Kili and the hobbit went along the shore to  the great bridge. There were guards at the  head of it, but they were not keeping very  careful watch, for it was so long since there had  been any real need. Except for occasional  squabbles about river-tolls they were friends  with the Wood-elves. Other folk were far away;  and some of the younger people in the town  openly doubted the existence of any dragon in  the mountain, and laughed at the greybeards  and gammers who said that they had seen him  flying in the sky in their young days. That being  so it is not surprising that the guards were  drinking and laughing by a fire in their hut, and  did not hear the noise of the unpacking of the  dwarves or the footsteps of the four scouts.  Their astonishment was enormous when Thorin  Oakenshield stepped in through the door.   “Who are you and what do you want?” they  shouted leaping to their feet and groping for     weapons.   “Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King  under the Mountain!” said the dwarf in a loud  voice, and he looked it, in spite of his torn  clothes and draggled hood. The gold gleamed  on his neck and waist; his eyes were dark and  deep. “I have come back. I wish to see the  Master of your town! ”   Then there was tremendous excitement.  Some of the more foolish ran out of the hut as if  they expected the Mountain to go golden in the  night and all the waters of the lake turn yellow  right away. The captain of the guard came  forward.   “And who are these?” he asked, pointing to  Fili and Kili and Bilbo.   “The sons of my father’s daughter,”  answered Thorin, “Fili and Kili of the race of  Durin, and Mr. Baggins who has travelled with  us out of the West.”   “If you come in peace lay down your arms!”  said the captain.   “We have none,” said Thorin, and it was  true enough: their knives had been taken from  them by the wood-elves, and the great sword  Orcrist too. Bilbo had his short sword, hidden  as usual, but he said nothing about that. “We  have no need of weapons, who return at last to  our own as spoken of old. Nor could we fight     against so many. Take us to your master!”   “He is at feast,” said the captain.   “Then all the more reason for taking us to  him,” burst in Fili, who was getting impatient at  these solemnities. “We are worn and famished  after our long road and we have sick comrades.  Now make haste and let us have no more  words, or your master may have something to  say to you.”   “Follow me then,” said the captain, and with  six men about them he led them over the bridge  through the gates and into the market-place of  the town. This was a wide circle of quiet water  surrounded by the tall piles on which were built  the greater houses, and by long wooden quays  with many steps and ladders going down to the  surface of the lake. From one great hall shone  many lights and there came the sound of many  voices. They passed its doors and stood  blinking in the light looking at long tables filled  with folk.   “I am Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King  under the Mountain! I return!” cried Thorin in a  loud voice from the door, before the captain  could say anything.   All leaped to their feet. The Master of the  town sprang from his great chair. But none rose  in greater surprise than the raft-men of the elves  who were sitting at the lower end of the hall.     Pressing forward before the Master’s table they  cried:   “These are prisoners of our king that have  escaped, wandering vagabond dwarves that  could not give any good account of themselves,  sneaking through the woods and molesting our  people!”   “Is this true?” asked the Master. As a matter  of fact he thought it far more likely than the  return of the King under the Mountain, if any  such person had ever existed.   “It is true that we were wrongfully waylaid by  the Elvenking and imprisoned without cause as  we journeyed back to our own land,” answered  Thorin. “But lock nor bar may hinder the  homecoming spoken of old. Nor is this town in  the Wood-elves’ realm. I speak to the Master of  the town of the Men of the Lake, not to the raft-  men of the king.”   Then the Master hesitated and looked from  one to the other. The Elvenking was very  powerful in those parts and the Master wished  for no enmity with him, nor did he think much of  old songs, giving his mind to trade and tolls, to  cargoes and gold, to which habit he owed his  position. Others were of different mind,  however, and quickly the matter was settled  without him. The news had spread from the  doors of the hall like fire through all the town.     People were shouting inside the hall and  outside it. The quays were thronged with  hurrying feet. Some began to sing snatches of  old songs concerning the return of the King  under the Mountain; that it was Thror’s  grandson not Thror himself that had come back  did not bother them at all. Others took up the  song and it rolled loud and high over the lake.    The King beneath the mountains,  The King of caive n stone,   The lord of silver fountains  Shall come into his ov\n!    His crown shall be upholden,  His harp shall be restrung,  His halls shall echo golden  To songs of yore re-sung.    The mods shall wave on mountains  And grass beneath the sun;   His wealth shall flowin fountains  And the rivers golden run.     The streams shall run in gladness,  The lakes shall shine and burn,  All sorrowfail and sadness  At the Mountain-king’s return!    So they sang, or very like that, only there  was a great deal more of it, and there was  much shouting as well as the music of harps  and of fiddles mixed up with it. Indeed such  excitement had not been known in the town in  the memory of the oldest grandfather. The  Wood-elves themselves began to wonder  greatly and even to be afraid. They did not know  of course how Thorin had escaped, and they  began to think their king might have made a  serious mistake. As for the Master he saw there  was nothing else for it but to obey the general  clamour, for the moment at any rate, and to  pretend to believe that Thorin was what he said.  So he gave up to him his own great chair and  set Fili and Kili beside him in places of honour.  Even Bilbo was given a seat at the high table,  and no explanation of where he came in — no  songs had alluded to him even in the obscurest  way — was asked for in the general bustle.   Soon afterwards the other dwarves were  brought into the town amid scenes of     astonishing enthusiasm. They were all doctored  and fed and housed and pampered in the most  delightful and satisfactory fashion. A large  house was given up to Thorin and his company;  boats and rowers were put at their service; and  crowds sat outside and sang songs all day, or  cheered if any dwarf showed so much as his  nose.   Some of the songs were old ones; but  some of them were quite new and spoke  confidently of the sudden death of the dragon  and of cargoes of rich presents coming down  the river to Lake-town. These were inspired  largely by the Master and they did not  particularly please the dwarves, but in the  meantime they were well contented and they  quickly grew fat and strong again. Indeed within  a week they were quite recovered, fitted out in  fine cloth of their proper colours, with beards  combed and trimmed, and proud steps. Thorin  looked and walked as if his kingdom was  already regained and Smaug chopped up into  little pieces.   Then, as he had said, the dwarves’ good  feeling towards the little hobbit grew stronger  every day. There were no more groans or  grumbles. They drank his health, and they  patted him on the back, and they made a great  fuss of him; which was just as well, for he was     not feeling particularly cheerful. He had not  forgotten the look of the Mountain, nor the  thought of the dragon, and he had besides a  shocking cold. For three days he sneezed and  coughed, and he could not go out, and even  after that his speeches at banquets were  limited to “Thag you very buch.”    In the meanwhile the Wood-elves had gone  back up the Forest River with their cargoes,  and there was great excitement in the king’s  palace. I have never heard what happened to  the chief of the guards and the butler. Nothing of  course was ever said about keys or barrels  while the dwarves stayed in Lake-town, and  Bilbo was careful never to become invisible.  Still, I daresay, more was guessed than was  known, though doubtless Mr. Baggins remained  a bit of a mystery. In any case the king knew  now the dwarves’ errand, or thought he did, and  he said to himself:   “Very well! We’ll see! No treasure will come  back through Mirkwood without my having  something to say in the matter. But I expect they  will all come to a bad end, and serve them  right!” He at any rate did not believe in dwarves  fighting and killing dragons like Smaug, and he     strongly suspected attempted burglary or  something like it — which shows he was a wise  elf and wiser than the men of the town, though  not quite right, as we shall see in the end. He  sent out his spies about the shores of the lake  and as far northward towards the Mountain as  they would go, and waited.   At the end of a fortnight Thorin began to  think of departure. While the enthusiasm still  lasted in the town was the time to get help. It  would not do to let everything cool down with  delay. So he spoke to the Master and his   councillors and said that soon he and his   company must go on towards the Mountain.   Then for the first time the Master was  surprised and a little frightened; and he   wondered if Thorin was after all really a   descendant of the old kings. He had never  thought that the dwarves would actually dare to  approach Smaug, but believed they were  frauds who would sooner or later be discovered  and be turned out. He was wrong. Thorin, of  course, was really the grandson of the King  under the Mountain, and there is no knowing  what a dwarf will not dare and do for revenge or  the recovery of his own.   But the Master was not sorry at all to let  them go. They were expensive to keep, and  their arrival had turned things into a long holiday     in which business was at a standstill. “Let them  go and bother Smaug, and see how he  welcomes them!” he thought. “Certainly, O  Thorin Thrain’s son Thror’s son!” was what he  said. “You must claim your own. The hour is at  hand, spoken of old. What help we can offer  shall be yours, and we trust to your gratitude  when your kingdom is regained.”   So one day, although autumn was now  getting far on, and winds were cold, and leaves  were falling fast, three large boats left Lake-  town, laden with rowers, dwarves, Mr. Baggins,  and many provisions. Horses and ponies had  been sent round by circuitous paths to meet  them at their appointed landing-place. The  Master and his councillors bade them farewell  from the great steps of the town-hall that went  down to the lake. People sang on the quays  and out of windows. The white oars dipped and  splashed, and off they went north up the lake on  the last stage of their long journey. The only  person thoroughly unhappy was Bilbo.      
Chapter XI    ON THE DOORSTEP    In two days going they rowed right up the Long  Lake and passed out into the River Running,  and now they could all see the Lonely Mountain  towering grim and tall before them. The stream  was strong and their going slow. At the end of  the third day, some miles up the river, they drew  in to the left or western bank and disembarked.  Here they were joined by the horses with other  provisions and necessaries and the ponies for  their own use that had been sent to meet them.  They packed what they could on the ponies and  the rest was made into a store under a tent, but  none of the men of the town would stay with  them even for the night so near the shadow of  the Mountain.   “Not at any rate until the songs have come  true!” said they. It was easier to believe in the  Dragon and less easy to believe in Thorin in  these wild parts. Indeed their stores had no  need of any guard, for all the land was desolate  and empty. So their escort left them, making off  swiftly down the river and the shoreward paths,  although the night was already drawing on.   They spent a cold and lonely night and their  spirits fell. The next day they set out again. Balin  and Bilbo rode behind, each leading another  pony heavily laden beside him; the others were  some way ahead picking out a slow road, for    there were no paths. They made north-west,  slanting away from the River Running, and  drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur  of the Mountain that was flung out southwards  towards them.   It was a weary journey, and a quiet and  stealthy one. There was no laughter or song or  sound of harps, and the pride and hopes which  had stirred in their hearts at the singing of old  songs by the lake died away to a plodding  gloom. They knew that they were drawing near  to the end of their journey, and that it might be a  very horrible end. The land about them grew  bleak and barren, though once, as Thorin told  them, it had been green and fair. There was  little grass, and before long there was neither  bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened  stumps to speak of ones long vanished. They  were come to the Desolation of the Dragon,  and they were come at the waning of the year.    They reached the skirts of the Mountain all the  same without meeting any danger or any sign of  the Dragon other than the wilderness he had  made about his lair. The Mountain lay dark and  silent before them and ever higher above them.  They made their first camp on the western side  of the great southern spur, which ended in a  height called Ravenhill. On this there had been  an old watch-post; but they dared not climb it  yet, it was too exposed.   Before setting out to search the western  spurs of the Mountain for the hidden door, on  which all their hopes rested, Thorin sent out a  scouting expedition to spy out the land to the  South where the Front Gate stood. For this     purpose he chose Balin and Fili and Kili, and  with them went Bilbo. They marched under the  grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill.  There the river, after winding a wide loop over  the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on  its road to the Lake, flowing swift and noisily. Its  bank was bare and rocky, tall and steep above  the stream; and gazing out from it over the  narrow water, foaming and splashing among  many boulders, they could see in the wide valley  shadowed by the Mountain’s arms the grey  ruins of ancient houses, towers, and walls.   “There lies all that is left of Dale,” said Balin.  “The mountain’s sides were green with woods  and all the sheltered valley rich and pleasant in  the days when the bells rang in that town.” He  looked both sad and grim as he said this: he  had been one of Thorin’s companions on the  day the Dragon came.   They did not dare to follow the river much  further towards the Gate; but they went on  beyond the end of the southern spur, until lying  hidden behind a rock they could look out and  see the dark cavernous opening in a great cliff-  wall between the arms of the Mountain. Out of it  the waters of the Running River sprang; and out  of it too there came a steam and a dark smoke.  Nothing moved in the waste, save the vapour  and the water, and every now and again a black  and ominous crow. The only sound was the  sound of the stony water, and every now and  again the harsh croak of a bird. Balin  shuddered.   “Let us return!” he said. “We can do no  good here! And I don’t like these dark birds,  they look like spies of evil.”      The Front Gate.    “The dragon is still alive and in the halls  under the Mountain then — or I imagine so from  the smoke," said the hobbit.     “That does not prove it,” said Balin, “though  I don’t doubt you are right. But he might be gone  away some time, or he might be lying out on the  mountain-side keeping watch, and still I expect  smokes and steams would come out of the  gates: all the halls within must be filled with his  foul reek.”    With such gloomy thoughts, followed ever by  croaking crows above them, they made their  weary way back to the camp. Only in June they  had been guests in the fair house of Elrond, and  though autumn was now crawling towards  winter that pleasant time now seemed years  ago. They were alone in the perilous waste  without hope of further help. They were at the  end of their journey, but as far as ever, it  seemed, from the end of their quest. None of  them had much spirit left.   Now strange to say Mr. Baggins had more  than the others. He would often borrow Thorin's  map and gaze at it, pondering over the runes  and the message of the moon-letters Elrond  had read. It was he that made the dwarves  begin the dangerous search on the western  slopes for the secret door. They moved their  camp then to a long valley, narrower than the  great dale in the South where the Gates of the  river stood, and walled with lower spurs of the  Mountain. Two of these here thrust forward west  from the main mass in long steep-sided ridges  that fell ever downwards towards the plain. On  this western side there were fewer signs of the  dragon’s marauding feet, and there was some  grass for their ponies. From this western camp,  shadowed all day by cliff and wall until the sun     began to sink towards the forest, day by day  they toiled in parties searching for paths up the  mountain-side, if the map was true, somewhere  high above the cliff at the valley’s head must  stand the secret door. Day by day they came  back to their camp without success.   But at last unexpectedly they found what  they were seeking. Fili and Kili and the hobbit  went back one day down the valley and  scrambled among the tumbled rocks at its  southern corner. About midday, creeping  behind a great stone that stood alone like a  pillar, Bilbo came on what looked like rough  steps going upwards. Following these excitedly  he and the dwarves found traces of a narrow  track, often lost, often rediscovered, that  wandered on to the top of the southern ridge  and brought them at last to a still narrower  ledge, which turned north across the face of the  Mountain. Looking down they saw that they  were at the top of the cliff at the valley’s head  and were gazing down on to their own camp  below. Silently, clinging to the rocky wall on their  right, they went in single file along the ledge, till  the wall opened and they turned into a little  steep-walled bay, grassy-floored, still and quiet.  Its entrance which they had found could not be  seen from below because of the overhang of  the cliff, nor from further off because it was so  small that it looked like a dark crack and no  more. It was not a cave and was open to the sky  above; but at its inner end a flat wall rose up  that in the lower part, close to the ground, was  as smooth and upright as masons' work, but  without a joint or crevice to be seen. No sign  was there of post or lintel or threshold, nor any  sign of bar or bolt or key-hole; yet they did not  doubt that they had found the door at last.     They beat on it, they thrust and pushed at it,  they implored it to move, they spoke fragments  of broken spells of opening, and nothing stirred.  At last tired out they rested on the grass at its  feet, and then at evening began their long climb  down.    There was excitement in the camp that night. In  the morning they prepared to move once more.  Only Bofur and Bombur were left behind to  guard the ponies and such stores as they had  brought with them from the river. The others  went down the valley and up the newly found  path, and so to the narrow ledge. Along this  they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow  and breathless was it, with a fall of a hundred  and fifty feet beside them on to sharp rocks  below; but each of them took a good coil of  rope wound tight about his waist, and so at last  without mishap they reached the little grassy  bay.   There they made their third camp, hauling  up what they needed from below with their  ropes. Down the same way they were able  occasionally to lower one of the more active  dwarves, such as Kili, to exchange such news  as there was, or to take a share in the guard  below, while Bofur was hauled up to the higher  camp. Bombur would not come up either the  rope or the path.   "I am too fat for such fly-walks,” he said. “I  should turn dizzy and tread on my beard, and  then you would be thirteen again. And the  knotted ropes are too slender for my weight.”  Luckily for him that was not true, as you will see.     In the meanwhile some of them explored the  ledge beyond the opening and found a path that  led higher and higher on to the mountain; but  they did not dare to venture very far that way,  nor was there much use in it. Out up there a  silence reigned, broken by no bird or sound  except that of the wind in the crannies of stone.  They spoke low and never called or sang, for  danger brooded in every rock. The others who  were busy with the secret of the door had no  more success. They were too eager to trouble  about the runes or the moon-letters, but tried  without resting to discover where exactly in the  smooth face of the rock the door was hidden.  They had brought picks and tools of many sorts  from Lake-town, and at first they tried to use  these. But when they struck the stone the  handles splintered and jarred their arms cruelly,  and the steel heads broke or bent like lead.  Mining work, they saw clearly, was no good  against the magic that had shut this door; and  they grew terrified, too, of the echoing noise.   Bilbo found sitting on the doorstep  lonesome and wearisome — there was not a  doorstep, of course, really, but they used to call  the little grassy space between the wall and the  opening the “doorstep” in fun, remembering  Bilbo's words long ago at the unexpected party  in his hobbit-hole, when he said they could sit  on the doorstep till they thought of something.  And sit and think they did, or wandered  aimlessly about, and glummer and glummer  they became.   Their spirits had risen a little at the  discovery of the path, but now they sank into  their boots; and yet they would not give it up and  go away. The hobbit was no longer much     brighter than the dwarves. He would do nothing  but sit with his back to the rock-face and stare  away west through the opening, over the cliff,  over the wide lands to the black wall of  Mirkwood, and to the distances beyond, in  which he sometimes thought he could catch  glimpses of the Misty Mountains small and far. If  the dwarves asked him what he was doing he  answered:   “You said sitting on the doorstep and  thinking would be my job, not to mention getting  inside, so I am sitting and thinking.” But I am  afraid he was not thinking much of the job, but  of what lay beyond the blue distance, the quiet  Western Land and the Hill and his hobbit-hole  under it.   A large grey stone lay in the centre of the  grass and he stared moodily at it or watched  the great snails. They seemed to love the little  shut-in bay with its walls of cool rock, and there  were many of them of huge size crawling slowly  and stickily along its sides.    “Tomorrow begins the last week of autumn,”  said Thorin one day.   “And winter comes after autumn,” said Bifur.   “And next year after that,” said Dwalin, “and  our beards will grow till they hang down the cliff  to the valley before anything happens here.  What is our burglar doing for us? Since he has  got an invisible ring, and ought to be a specially  excellent performer now, I am beginning to think  he might go through the Front Gate and spy  things out a bit!"   Bilbo heard this — the dwarves were on the  rocks just above the enclosure where he was     sitting — and “Good Gracious!” he thought, “so  that is what they are beginning to think, is it? It  is always poor me that has to get them out of  their difficulties, at least since the wizard left.  Whatever am I going to do? I might have known  that something dreadful would happen to me in  the end. I don’t think I could bear to see the  unhappy valley of Dale again, and as for that  steaming gate! I I”   That night he was very miserable and hardly  slept. Next day the dwarves all went wandering  off in various directions; some were exercising  the ponies down below, some were roving  about the mountain-side. All day Bilbo sat  gloomily in the grassy bay gazing at the stone,  or out west through the narrow opening. He had  a queer feeling that he was waiting for  something. “Perhaps the wizard will suddenly  come back today,” he thought.   If he lifted his head he could see a glimpse  of the distant forest. As the sun turned west  there was a gleam of yellow upon its far roof, as  if the light caught the last pale leaves. Soon he  saw the orange ball of the sun sinking towards  the level of his eyes. He went to the opening  and there pale and faint was a thin new moon  above the rim of Earth.   At that very moment he heard a sharp crack  behind him. There on the grey stone in the  grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal  black, its pale yellow breast freckled with dark  spots. Crack! It had caught a snail and was  knocking it on the stone. Crack! Crack!   Suddenly Bilbo understood. Forgetting all  danger he stood on the ledge and hailed the  dwarves, shouting and waving. Those that were  nearest came tumbling over the rocks and as  fast as they could along the ledge to him,     wondering what on earth was the matter; the  others shouted to be hauled up the ropes  (except Bombur, of course: he was asleep).   Quickly Bilbo explained. They all fell silent:  the hobbit standing by the grey stone, and the  dwarves with wagging beards watching  impatiently. The sun sank lower and lower, and  their hopes fell. It sank into a belt of reddened  cloud and disappeared. The dwarves groaned,  but still Bilbo stood almost without moving. The  little moon was dipping to the horizon. Evening  was coming on. Then suddenly when their hope  was lowest a red ray of the sun escaped like a  finger through a rent in the cloud. A gleam of  light came straight through the opening into the  bay and fell on the smooth rock-face. The old  thrush, who had been watching from a high  perch with beady eyes and head cocked on  one side, gave a sudden trill. There was a loud  crack. A flake of rock split from the wall and fell.  A hole appeared suddenly about three feet from  the ground.   Quickly, trembling lest the chance should  fade, the dwarves rushed to the rock and  pushed — in vain.   “The key! The key!" cried Bilbo. “Where is  Thorin?"   Thorin hurried up.   “The key!" shouted Bilbo. “The key that went  with the map! Try it now while there is still time!”   Then Thorin stepped up and drew the key  on its chain from round his neck. He put it to the  hole. It fitted and it turned! Snap! The gleam  went out, the sun sank, the moon was gone, and  evening sprang into the sky.   Now they all pushed together, and slowly a  part of the rock-wall gave way. Long straight  cracks appeared and widened. A door five feet     high and three broad was outlined, and slowly  without a sound swung inwards. It seemed as if  darkness flowed out like a vapour from the hole  in the mountain-side, and deep darkness in  which nothing could be seen lay before their  eyes, a yawning mouth leading in and down.      
Chapter XII    INSIDE INFORMATION    For a long time the dwarves stood in the dark  before the door and debated, until at last Thorin  spoke:   “Now is the time for our esteemed Mr.  Baggins, who has proved himself a good  companion on our long road, and a hobbit full of  courage and resource far exceeding his size,  and if I may say so possessed of good luck far  exceeding the usual allowance — now is the  time for him to perform the service for which he  was included in our Company; now is the time  for him to earn his Reward.”   You are familiar with Thorin’s style on  important occasions, so I will not give you any  more of it, though he went on a good deal  longer than this. It certainly was an important  occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he  was quite familiar with Thorin too, and he knew  what he was driving at.    “If you mean you think it is my job to go into  the secret passage first, O Thorin Thrain’s son  Oakenshield, may your beard grow ever  longer," he said crossly, “say so at once and  have done! I might refuse. I have got you out of  two messes already, which were hardly in the  original bargain, so that I am, I think, already  owed some reward. But ‘third time pays for all’  as my father used to say, and somehow I don’t  think I shall refuse. Perhaps I have begun to  trust my luck more than I used to in the old  days” — he meant last spring before he left his  own house, but it seemed centuries ago — “but  anyway I think I will go and have a peep at once  and get it over. Now who is coming with me?”   He did not expect a chorus of volunteers, so  he was not disappointed. Fili and Kili looked  uncomfortable and stood on one leg, but the  others made no pretence of offering — except  old Balin, the lookout man, who was rather fond  of the hobbit. He said he would come inside at  least and perhaps a bit of the way too, ready to  call for help if necessary.   The most that can be said for the dwarves  is this: they intended to pay Bilbo really  handsomely for his services; they had brought  him to do a nasty job for them, and they did not  mind the poor little fellow doing it if he would;  but they would all have done their best to get     him out of trouble, if he got into it, as they did in  the case of the trolls at the beginning of their  adventures before they had any particular  reasons for being grateful to him. There it is:  dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk with  a great idea of the value of money; some are  tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots;  some are not, but are decent enough people  like Thorin and Company, if you don’t expect  too much.    The stars were coming out behind him in a pale  sky barred with black when the hobbit crept  through the enchanted door and stole into the  Mountain. It was far easier going than he  expected. This was no goblin entrance, or  rough wood-elves’ cave. It was a passage  made by dwarves, at the height of their wealth  and skill: straight as a ruler, smooth-floored and  smooth-sided, going with a gentle never-varying  slope direct — to some distant end in the  blackness below.   After a while Balin bade Bilbo “Good luck!”  and stopped where he could still see the faint  outline of the door, and by a trick of the echoes  of the tunnel hear the rustle of the whispering  voices of the others just outside. Then the     hobbit slipped on his ring, and warned by the  echoes to take more than hobbit’s care to  make no sound, he crept noiselessly down,  down, down into the dark. He was trembling  with fear, but his little face was set and grim.  Already he was a very different hobbit from the  one that had run out without a pocket-  handkerchief from Bag-End long ago. He had  not had a pocket-handkerchief for ages. He  loosened his dagger in its sheath, tightened his  belt, and went on.    “Now you are in for it at last, Bilbo Baggins,” he  said to himself. “You went and put your foot right  in it that night of the party, and now you have got  to pull it out and pay for it! Dear me, what a fool  I was and am!” said the least Tookish part of  him. “I have absolutely no use for dragon-  guarded treasures, and the whole lot could stay  here for ever, if only I could wake up and find  this beastly tunnel was my own front-hall at  home!”   He did not wake up of course, but went still  on and on, till all sign of the door behind had  faded away. He was altogether alone. Soon he  thought it was beginning to feel warm. “Is that a  kind of a glow I seem to see coming right     ahead down there?” he thought.   It was. As he went forward it grew and grew,  till there was no doubt about it. It was a red light  steadily getting redder and redder. Also it was  now undoubtedly hot in the tunnel. Wisps of  vapour floated up and past him and he began to  sweat. A sound, too, began to throb in his ears,  a sort of bubbling like the noise of a large pot  galloping on the fire, mixed with a rumble as of  a gigantic tom-cat purring. This grew to the  unmistakable gurgling noise of some vast  animal snoring in its sleep down there in the red  glow in front of him.   It was at this point that Bilbo stopped.  Going on from there was the bravest thing he  ever did. The tremendous things that happened  afterwards were as nothing compared to it. He  fought the real battle in the tunnel alone, before  he ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait. At  any rate after a short halt go on he did; and you  can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel,  an opening of much the same size and shape  as the door above. Through it peeps the  hobbit’s little head. Before him lies the great  bottom-most cellar or dungeon-hall of the  ancient dwarves right at the Mountain’s root. It  is almost dark so that its vastness can only be  dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of  the rocky floor there is a great glow. The glow of     Smaug!    There he lay, a vast red-golden dragon, fast  asleep; a thrumming came from his jaws and  nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his fires were  low in slumber. Beneath him, under all his limbs  and his huge coiled tail, and about him on all  sides stretching away across the unseen floors,  lay countless piles of precious things, gold  wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and  silver red-stained in the ruddy light.   Smaug lay, with wings folded like an  immeasurable bat, turned partly on one side, so  that the hobbit could see his underparts and his  long pale belly crusted with gems and  fragments of gold from his long lying on his  costly bed. Behind him where the walls were  nearest could dimly be seen coats of mail,  helms and axes, swords and spears hanging;  and there in rows stood great jars and vessels  filled with a wealth that could not be guessed.   To say that Bilbo’s breath was taken away  is no description at all. There are no words left  to express his staggerment, since Men  changed the language that they learned of elves  in the days when all the world was wonderful.  Bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards     before, but the splendour, the lust, the glory of  such treasure had never yet come home to him.  His heart was filled and pierced with  enchantment and with the desire of dwarves;  and he gazed motionless, almost forgetting the  frightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and  count.    He gazed for what seemed an age, before  drawn almost against his will, he stole from the  shadow of the doorway, across the floor to the  nearest edge of the mounds of treasure. Above  him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace  even in his sleep. He grasped a great two-  handled cup, as heavy as he could carry, and  cast one fearful eye upwards. Smaug stirred a  wing, opened a claw, the rumble of his snoring  changed its note.   Then Bilbo fled. But the dragon did not  wake — not yet — but shifted into other dreams of  greed and violence, lying there in his stolen hall  while the little hobbit toiled back up the long  tunnel. His heart was beating and a more  fevered shaking was in his legs than when he  was going down, but still he clutched the cup,  and his chief thought was: “I’ve done it! This will  show them. ‘More like a grocer than a burglar’     indeed! Well, we’ll hear no more of that.”   Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the  hobbit again, and as delighted as he was  surprised. He picked Bilbo up and carried him  out into the open air. It was midnight and clouds  had covered the stars, but Bilbo lay with his  eyes shut, gasping and taking pleasure in the  feel of the fresh air again, and hardly noticing  the excitement of the dwarves, or how they  praised him and patted him on the back and put  themselves and all their families for generations  to come at his service.    The dwarves were still passing the cup from  hand to hand and talking delightedly of the  recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast  rumbling woke in the mountain underneath as if  it was an old volcano that had made up its mind  to start eruptions once again. The door behind  them was pulled nearly to, and blocked from  closing with a stone, but up the long tunnel  came the dreadful echoes, from far down in the  depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that  made the ground beneath them tremble.   Then the dwarves forgot their joy and their  confident boasts of a moment before and  cowered down in fright. Smaug was still to be     reckoned with. It does not do to leave a live  dragon out of your calculations, if you live near  him. Dragons may not have much real use for  all their wealth, but they know it to an ounce as a  rule, especially after long possession; and  Smaug was no exception. He had passed from  an uneasy dream (in which a warrior, altogether  insignificant in size but provided with a bitter  sword and great courage, figured most  unpleasantly) to a doze, and from a doze to  wide waking. There was a breath of strange air  in his cave. Could there be a draught from that  little hole? He had never felt quite happy about  it, though it was so small, and now he glared at  it in suspicion and wondered why he had never  blocked it up. Of late he had half fancied he had  caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound  from far above that came down through it to his  lair. He stirred and stretched forth his neck to  sniff. Then he missed the cup!   Thieves! Fire! Murder! Such a thing had not  happened since first he came to the Mountain!  His rage passes description — the sort of rage  that is only seen when rich folk that have more  than they can enjoy suddenly lose something  that they have long had but have never before  used or wanted. His fire belched forth, the hall  smoked, he shook the mountain-roots. He thrust  his head in vain at the little hole, and then     coiling his length together, roaring like thunder  underground, he sped from his deep lair  through its great door, out into the huge  passages of the mountain-palace and up  towards the Front Gate.   To hunt the whole mountain till he had  caught the thief and had torn and trampled him  was his one thought. He issued from the Gate,  the waters rose in fierce whistling steam, and  up he soared blazing into the air and settled on  the mountain-top in a spout of green and scarlet  flame. The dwarves heard the awful rumour of  his flight, and they crouched against the walls of  the grassy terrace cringing under boulders,  hoping somehow to escape the frightful eyes of  the hunting dragon.   There they would have all been killed, if it  had not been for Bilbo once again. “Quick!  Quick!” he gasped. “The door! The tunnel! It’s  no good here.”   Roused by these words they were just  about to creep inside the tunnel when Bifur  gave a cry: “My cousins! Bombur and Bofur —  we have forgotten them, they are down in the  valley!”   “They will be slain, and all our ponies too,  and all our stores lost,” moaned the others. “We  can do nothing.”   “Nonsense!” said Thorin, recovering his     dignity. “We cannot leave them. Get inside Mr.  Baggins and Balin, and you two Fili and Kili —  the dragon shan’t have all of us. Now you  others, where are the ropes? Be quick!”   Those were perhaps the worst moments  they had been through yet. The horrible sounds  of Smaug’s anger were echoing in the stony  hollows far above; at any moment he might  come blazing down or fly whirling round and find  them there, near the perilous cliffs edge hauling  madly on the ropes. Up came Bofur, and still all  was safe. Up came Bombur, puffing and  blowing while the ropes creaked, and still all  was safe. Up came some tools and bundles of  stores, and then danger was upon them.   A whirring noise was heard. A red light  touched the points of standing rocks. The  dragon came.   They had barely time to fly back to the  tunnel, pulling and dragging in their bundles,  when Smaug came hurtling from the North,  licking the mountain-sides with flame, beating  his great wings with a noise like a roaring wind.  His hot breath shrivelled the grass before the  door, and drove in through the crack they had  left and scorched them as they lay hid.  Flickering fires leaped up and black rock-  shadows danced. Then darkness fell as he  passed again. The ponies screamed with     terror, burst their ropes and galloped wildly off.  The dragon swooped and turned to pursue  them, and was gone.   “That’ll be the end of our poor beasts!” said  Thorin. “Nothing can escape Smaug once he  sees it. Here we are and here we shall have to  stay, unless any one fancies tramping the long  open miles back to the river with Smaug on the  watch!”   It was not a pleasant thought! They crept  further down the tunnel, and there they lay and  shivered though it was warm and stuffy, until  dawn came pale through the crack of the door.  Every now and again through the night they  could hear the roar of the flying dragon grow  and then pass and fade, as he hunted round  and round the mountain-sides.   He guessed from the ponies, and from the  traces of the camps he had discovered, that  men had come up from the river and the lake  and had scaled the mountain-side from the  valley where the ponies had been standing; but  the door withstood his searching eye, and the  little high-walled bay had kept out his fiercest  flames. Long he had hunted in vain till the dawn  chilled his wrath and he went back to his golden  couch to sleep — and to gather new strength. He  would not forget or forgive the theft, not if a  thousand years turned him to smouldering     stone, but he could afford to wait. Slow and  silent he crept back to his lair and half closed  his eyes.   When morning came the terror of the  dwarves grew less. They realized that dangers  of this kind were inevitable in dealing with such  a guardian, and that it was no good giving up  their quest yet. Nor could they get away just  now, as Thorin had pointed out. Their ponies  were lost or killed, and they would have to wait  some time before Smaug relaxed his watch  sufficiently for them to dare the long way on foot.  Luckily they had saved enough of their stores to  last them still for some time.   They debated long on what was to be done,  but they could think of no way of getting rid of  Smaug — which had always been a weak point  in their plans, as Bilbo felt inclined to point out.  Then as is the nature of folk that are thoroughly  perplexed, they began to grumble at the hobbit,  blaming him for what had at first so pleased  them: for bringing away a cup and stirring up  Smaug’s wrath so soon.   “What else do you suppose a burglar is to  do?” asked Bilbo angrily. “I was not engaged to  kill dragons, that is warrior’s work, but to steal  treasure. I made the best beginning I could. Did  you expect me to trot back with the whole hoard  of Thror on my back? If there is any grumbling to     be done, I think I might have a say. You ought to  have brought five hundred burglars not one. I  am sure it reflects great credit on your  grandfather, but you cannot pretend that you  ever made the vast extent of his wealth clear to  me. I should want hundreds of years to bring it  all up, if I was fifty times as big, and Smaug as  tame as a rabbit.”   After that of course the dwarves begged his  pardon. “What then do you propose we should  do, Mr. Baggins?” asked Thorin politely.   “I have no idea at the moment — if you mean  about removing the treasure. That obviously  depends entirely on some new turn of luck and  the getting rid of Smaug. Getting rid of dragons  is not at all in my line, but I will do my best to  think about it. Personally I have no hopes at all,  and wish I was safe back at home.”   "Never mind that for the moment! What are  we to do now, to-day?”   “Well, if you really want my advice, I should  say we can do nothing but stay where we are.  By day we can no doubt creep out safely  enough to take the air. Perhaps before long one  or two could be chosen to go back to the store  by the river and replenish our supplies. But in  the meanwhile everyone ought to be well inside  the tunnel by night.   “Now I will make you an offer. I have got my     ring and will creep down this very noon — then if  ever Smaug ought to be napping — and see  what he is up to. Perhaps something will turn  up. ‘Every worm has his weak spot,’ as my  father used to say, though I am sure it was not  from personal experience.”   Naturally the dwarves accepted the offer  eagerly. Already they had come to respect little  Bilbo. Now he had become the real leader in  their adventure. He had begun to have ideas  and plans of his own. When midday came he  got ready for another journey down into the  Mountain. He did not like it of course, but it was  not so bad now he knew, more or less, what  was in front of him. Had he known more about  dragons and their wily ways, he might have  been more frightened and less hopeful of  catching this one napping.   The sun was shining when he started, but it  was as dark as night in the tunnel. The light from  the door, almost closed, soon faded as he went  down. So silent was his going that smoke on a  gentle wind could hardly have surpassed it, and  he was inclined to feel a bit proud of himself as  he drew near the lower door. There was only the  veryfaintestglowto be seen.   “Old Smaug is weary and asleep,” he  thought. “He can’t see me and he won’t hear  me. Cheer up Bilbo!” He had forgotten or had     never heard about dragons’ sense of smell. It is  also an awkward fact that they can keep half an  eye open watching while they sleep, if they are  suspicious.   Smaug certainly looked fast asleep, almost  dead and dark, with scarcely a snore more than  a whiff of unseen steam, when Bilbo peeped  once more from the entrance. He was just about  to step out on to the floor when he caught a  sudden thin and piercing ray of red from under  the drooping lid of Smaug’s left eye. He was  only pretending to sleep! He was watching the  tunnel entrance! Hurriedly Bilbo stepped back  and blessed the luck of his ring. Then Smaug  spoke.    “Well, thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear  your breath. Come along! Help yourself again,  there is plenty and to spare!”   But Bilbo was not quite so unlearned in  dragon-lore as all that, and if Smaug hoped to  get him to come nearer so easily he was  disappointed. "No thank you, O Smaug the  Tremendous!” he replied. “I did not come for  presents. I only wished to have a look at you  and see if you were truly as great as tales say. I  did not believe them.”     “Do you now?” said the dragon somewhat  flattered, even thouqh he did not believe a word  of it.   “Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of the  reality, O Smaug the Chiefest and Greatest of  Calamities,” replied Bilbo.   “You have nice manners for a thief and a  liar,” said the dragon. “You seem familiar with  my name, but I don’t seem to remember  smelling you before. Who are you and where do  you come from, may I ask?”   “You may indeed! I come from under the hill,  and under the hills and over the hills my paths  led. And through the air. I am he that walks  unseen.”   “So I can well believe,” said Smaug, “but  that is hardly your usual name.”   “I am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the  stinging fly. I was chosen for the lucky number.”   “Lovely titles!” sneered the dragon. “But  lucky numbers don’t always come off.”   “I am he that buries his friends alive and  drowns them and draws them alive again from  the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no  bag went over me.”   “These don’t sound so creditable,” scoffed  Smaug.   “I am the friend of bears and the guest of  eagles. I am Ringwinner and Luckwearer; and I     am Barrel-rider,” went on Bilbo beginning to be  pleased with his riddling.   “That’s better!” said Smaug. “But don’t let  your imagination run away with you!”    This of course is the way to talk to dragons, if  you don’t want to reveal your proper name  (which is wise), and don’t want to infuriate them  by a flat refusal (which is also very wise). No  dragon can resist the fascination of riddling talk  and of wasting time trying to understand it.  There was a lot here which Smaug did not  understand at all (though I expect you do, since  you know all about Bilbo’s adventures to which  he was referring), but he thought he understood  enough, and he chuckled in his wicked inside.   “I thought so last night,” he smiled to  himself. “Lake-men, some nasty scheme of  those miserable tub-trading Lake-men, or I’m a  lizard. I haven’t been down that way for an age  and an age; but I will soon alter that!”   “Very well, O Barrel-rider!” he said aloud.  “Maybe Barrel was your pony’s name; and  maybe not, though it was fat enough. You may  walk unseen, but you did not walk all the way.  Let me tell you I ate six ponies last night and I  shall catch and eat all the others before long. In     return for the excellent meal I will give you one  piece of advice for your good: don’t have more  to do with dwarves than you can help!”   “Dwarves!” said Bilbo in pretended  surprise.   “Don’t talk to me!” said Smaug. “I know the  smell (and taste) of dwarf — no one better. Don’t  tell me that I can eat a dwarf-ridden pony and  not know it! You’ll come to a bad end, if you go  with such friends, Thief Barrel-rider. I don’t mind  if you go back and tell them so from me.” But he  did not tell Bilbo that there was one smell he  could not make out at all, hobbit-smell; it was  quite outside his experience and puzzled him  mightily.   “I suppose you got a fair price for that cup  last night?” he went on. “Come now, did you?  Nothing at all! Well, that’s just like them. And I  suppose they are skulking outside, and your job  is to do all the dangerous work and get what  you can when I’m not looking — for them? And  you will get a fair share? Don’t you believe it! If  you get off alive, you will be lucky.”    Bilbo was now beginning to feel really  uncomfortable. Whenever Smaug’s roving eye,  seeking for him in the shadows, flashed across     him, he trembled, and an unaccountable desire  seized hold of him to rush out and reveal  himself and tell all the truth to Smaug. In fact he  was in grievous danger of coming under the  dragon-spell. But plucking up courage he spoke  again.   “You don’t know everything, O Smaug the  Mighty,” said he. “Not gold alone brought us  hither.”   “Ha! Ha! You admit the ‘us’” laughed  Smaug. “Why not say ‘us fourteen’ and be done  with it, Mr. Lucky Number? I am pleased to hear  that you had other business in these parts  besides my gold. In that case you may,  perhaps, not altogether waste your time.   “I don’t know if it has occurred to you that,  even if you could steal the gold bit by bit — a  matter of a hundred years or so — you could not  get it very far? Not much use on the mountain-  side? Not much use in the forest? Bless me!  Had you never thought of the catch? A  fourteenth share, I suppose, or something like it,  those were the terms, eh? But what about  delivery? What about cartage? What about  armed guards and tolls?” And Smaug laughed  aloud. He had a wicked and a wily heart, and he  knew his guesses were not far out, though he  suspected that the Lake-men were at the back  of the plans, and that most of the plunder was     meant to stop there in the town by the shore that  in his young days had been called Esgaroth.   You will hardly believe it, but poor Bilbo was  really very taken aback. So far all his thoughts  and energies had been concentrated on getting  to the Mountain and finding the entrance. He  had never bothered to wonder how the treasure  was to be removed, certainly never how any  part of it that might fall to his share was to be  brought back all the way to Bag-End Under-Hill.   Now a nasty suspicion began to grow in his  mind — had the dwarves forgotten this important  point too, or were they laughing in their sleeves  at him all the time? That is the effect that  dragon-talk has on the inexperienced. Bilbo of  course ought to have been on his guard; but  Smaug had rather an overwhelming personality.   “I tell you," he said, in an effort to remain  loyal to his friends and to keep his end up, “that  gold was only an afterthought with us. We came  over hill and under hill, by wave and wind, for  Revenge. Surely, O Smaug the unassessably  wealthy, you must realize that your success has  made you some bitter enemies?”   Then Smaug really did laugh — a  devastating sound which shook Bilbo to the  floor, while far up in the tunnel the dwarves  huddled together and imagined that the hobbit  had come to a sudden and a nasty end.     "Revenge!” he snorted, and the light of his  eyes lit the hall from floor to ceiling like scarlet  lightning. ‘‘Revenge! The King under the  Mountain is dead and where are his kin that  dare seek revenge? Girion Lord of Dale is  dead, and I have eaten his people like a wolf  among sheep, and where are his sons’ sons  that dare approach me? I kill where I wish and  none dare resist. I laid low the warriors of old  and their like is not in the world today. Then I  was but young and tender. Now I am old and  strong, strong, strong, Thief in the Shadows!” he  gloated. “My armour is like tenfold shields, my  teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock  of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane,  and my breath death!”   “I have always understood,” said Bilbo in a  frightened squeak, “that dragons were softer  underneath, especially in the region of the — er  — chest; but doubtless one so fortified has  thought of that.”   The dragon stopped short in his boasting.  “Your information is antiquated,” he snapped. “I  am armoured above and below with iron scales  and hard gems. No blade can pierce me.”   “I might have guessed it,” said Bilbo. “Truly  there can nowhere be found the equal of Lord  Smaug the Impenetrable. What magnificence to  possess a waistcoat of fine diamonds!”     “Yes, it is rare and wonderful, indeed,” said  Smaug absurdly pleased. He did not know that  the hobbit had already caught a glimpse of his  peculiar under-covering on his previous visit,  and was itching for a closer view for reasons of  his own. The dragon rolled over. “Look!” he  said. “What do you say to that?”   “Dazzlingly marvellous! Perfect! Flawless!  Staggering!” exclaimed Bilbo aloud, but what  he thought inside was: “Old fool! Why, there is a  large patch in the hollow of his left breast as  bare as a snail out of its shell!”   After he had seen that Mr. Baggins’ one  idea was to get away. “Well, I really must not  detain Your Magnificence any longer,” he said,  “or keep you from much needed rest. Ponies  take some catching, I believe, after a long start.  And so do burglars,” he added as a parting  shot, as he darted back and fled up the tunnel.   It was an unfortunate remark, for the dragon  spouted terrific flames after him, and fast  though he sped up the slope, he had not gone  nearly far enough to be comfortable before the  ghastly head of Smaug was thrust against the  opening behind. Luckily the whole head and  jaws could not squeeze in, but the nostrils sent  forth fire and vapour to pursue him, and he was  nearly overcome, and stumbled blindly on in  great pain and fear. He had been feeling rather     pleased with the cleverness of his conversation  with Smaug, but his mistake at the end shook  him into better sense.   "Never laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you  fool!” he said to himself, and it became a  favourite saying of his later, and passed into a  proverb. ‘‘You aren’t nearly through this  adventure yet,” he added, and that was pretty  true as well.    The afternoon was turning into evening when he  came out again and stumbled and fell in a faint  on the ‘doorstep’. The dwarves revived him,  and doctored his scorches as well as they  could; but it was a long time before the hair on  the back of his head and his heels grew  properly again: it had all been singed and  frizzled right down to the skin. In the meanwhile  his friends did their best to cheer him up; and  they were eager for his story, especially wanting  to know why the dragon had made such an  awful noise, and how Bilbo had escaped.   But the hobbit was worried and  uncomfortable, and they had difficulty in getting  anything out of him. On thinking things over he  was now regretting some of the things he had  said to the dragon, and was not eager to repeat     them. The old thrush was sitting on a rock near  by with his head cocked on one side, listening  to all that was said. It shows what an ill temper  Bilbo was in: he picked up a stone and threw it  at the thrush, which merely fluttered aside and  came back.   “Drat the bird!” said Bilbo crossly. “I believe  he is listening, and I don’t like the look of him.”   “Leave him alone!” said Thorin. “The  thrushes are good and friendly — this is a very  old bird indeed, and is maybe the last left of the  ancient breed that used to live about here, tame  to the hands of my father and grandfather. They  were a long-lived and magical race, and this  might even be one of those that were alive then,  a couple of hundreds of years or more ago. The  Men of Dale used to have the trick of  understanding their language, and used them  for messengers to fly to the Men of the Lake  and elsewhere.”   “Well, he’ll have news to take to Lake-town  all right, if that is what he is after,” said Bilbo;  “though I don’t suppose there are any people  left there that trouble with thrush-language.”   “Why what has happened?” cried the  dwarves. “Do get on with your tale!”   So Bilbo told them all he could remember,  and he confessed that he had a nasty feeling  that the dragon guessed too much from his     riddles added to the camps and the ponies. “I  am sure he knows we came from Lake-town  and had help from there; and I have a horrible  feeling that his next move may be in that  direction. I wish to goodness I had never said  that about Barrel-rider; it would make even a  blind rabbit in these parts think of the Lake-  men.”   “Well, well! It cannot be helped, and it is  difficult not to slip in talking to a dragon, or so I  have always heard,” said Balin anxious to  comfort him. “I think you did very well, if you ask  me — you found out one very useful thing at any  rate, and got home alive, and that is more than  most can say who have had words with the likes  of Smaug. It may be a mercy and a blessing yet  to know of the bare patch in the old Worm’s  diamond waistcoat.”   That turned the conversation, and they all  began discussing dragon-slayings historical,  dubious, and mythical, and the various sorts of  stabs and jabs and undercuts, and the different  arts devices and stratagems by which they had  been accomplished. The general opinion was  that catching a dragon napping was not as easy  as it sounded, and the attempt to stick one or  prod one asleep was more likely to end in  disaster than a bold frontal attack. All the while  they talked the thrush listened, till at last when     the stars began to peep forth, it silently spread  its wings and flew away. And all the while they  talked and the shadows lengthened Bilbo  became more and more unhappy and his  foreboding grew.   At last he interrupted them. “I am sure we  are very unsafe here,” he said, “and I don’t see  the point of sitting here. The dragon has  withered all the pleasant green, and anyway the  night has come and it is cold. But I feel it in my  bones that this place will be attacked again.  Smaug knows now how I came down to his hall,  and you can trust him to guess where the other  end of the tunnel is. He will break all this side of  the Mountain to bits, if necessary, to stop up our  entrance, and if we are smashed with it the  better he will like it.”   “You are very gloomy, Mr. Baggins!” said  Thorin. “Why has not Smaug blocked the lower  end, then, if he is so eager to keep us out? He  has not, or we should have heard him.”   “I don’t know, I don’t know — because at first  he wanted to try and lure me in again, I  suppose, and now perhaps because he is  waiting till after tonight’s hunt, or because he  does not want to damage his bedroom if he can  help it — but I wish you would not argue. Smaug  will be coming out at any minute now, and our  only hope is to get well in the tunnel and shut the     door.”   He seemed so much in earnest that the  dwarves at last did as he said, though they  delayed shutting the door — it seemed a  desperate plan, for no one knew whether or  how they could get it open again from the  inside, and the thought of being shut in a place  from which the only way out led through the  dragon’s lair was not one they liked. Also  everything seemed quite quiet, both outside  and down the tunnel. So for a longish while they  sat inside not far down from the half-open door  and went on talking.   The talk turned to the dragon’s wicked  words about the dwarves. Bilbo wished he had  never heard them, or at least that he could feel  quite certain that the dwarves now were  absolutely honest when they declared that they  had never thought at all about what would  happen after the treasure had been won. “We  knew it would be a desperate venture,” said  Thorin, “and we know that still; and I still think  that when we have won it will be time enough to  think what to do about it. As for your share, Mr.  Baggins, I assure you we are more than grateful  and you shall choose your own fourteenth, as  soon as we have anything to divide. I am sorry if  you are worried about transport, and I admit the  difficulties are great — the lands have not     become less wild with the passing of time,  rather the reverse — but we will do whatever we  can for you, and take our share of the cost when  the time comes. Believe me or not as you like!”   From that the talk turned to the great hoard  itself and to the things that Thorin and Balin  remembered. They wondered if they were still  lying there unharmed in the hall below: the  spears that were made for the armies of the  great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each  had a thrice-forged head and their shafts were  inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never  delivered or paid for; shields made for warriors  long dead; the great golden cup of Thror, two-  handed, hammered and carven with birds and  flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels;  coats of mail gilded and silvered and  impenetrable; the necklace of Girion, Lord of  Dale, made of five hundred emeralds green as  grass, which he gave for the arming of his  eldest son in a coat of dwarf-linked rings the  like of which had never been made before, for it  was wrought of pure silver to the power and  strength of triple steel. But fairest of all was the  great white gem, which the dwarves had found  beneath the roots of the Mountain, the Heart of  the Mountain, the Arkenstone of Thrain.   “The Arkenstone! The Arkenstone!”  murmured Thorin in the dark, half dreaming with     his chin upon his knees. “It was like a globe with  a thousand facets; it shone like silver in the  firelight, like water in the sun, like snow under  the stars, like rain upon the Moon!”   But the enchanted desire of the hoard had  fallen from Bilbo. All through their talk he was  only half listening to them. He sat nearest to the  door with one ear cocked for any beginnings of  a sound without, his other was alert for echoes  beyond the murmurs of the dwarves, for any  whisper of a movement from far below.   Darkness grew deeper and he grew ever  more uneasy. “Shut the door!” he begged them,  “I fear that dragon in my marrow. I like this  silence far less than the uproar of last night.  Shut the door before it is too late!”   Something in his voice gave the dwarves  an uncomfortable feeling. Slowly Thorin shook  off his dreams and getting up he kicked away  the stone that wedged the door. Then they thrust  upon it, and it closed with a snap and a clang.  No trace of a keyhole was there left on the  inside. They were shut in the Mountain!   And not a moment too soon. They had  hardly gone any distance down the tunnel when  a blow smote the side of the Mountain like the  crash of battering-rams made of forest oaks  and swung by giants. The rock boomed, the  walls cracked and stones fell from the roof on     their heads. What would have happened if the  door had still been open I don’t like to think.  They fled further down the tunnel glad to be still  alive, while behind them outside they heard the  roar and rumble of Smaug’s fury. He was  breaking rocks to pieces, smashing wall and  cliff with the lashings of his huge tail, till their  little lofty camping ground, the scorched grass,  the thrush’s stone, the snail-covered walls, the  narrow ledge, and all disappeared in a jumble  of smithereens, and an avalanche of splintered  stones fell over the cliff into the valley below.   Smaug had left his lair in silent stealth,  quietly soared into the air, and then floated  heavy and slow in the dark like a monstrous  crow, down the wind towards the west of the  Mountain, in the hopes of catching unawares  something or somebody there, and of spying  the outlet to the passage which the thief had  used. This was the outburst of his wrath when  he could find nobody and see nothing, even  where he guessed the outlet must actually be.   After he had let off his rage in this way he  felt better and he thought in his heart that he  would not be troubled again from that direction.  In the meanwhile he had further vengeance to  take. “Barrel-rider!” he snorted. “Your feet came  from the waterside and up the water you came  without a doubt. I don’t know your smell, but if     you are not one of those men of the Lake, you  had their help. They shall see me and  remember who is the real King under the  Mountain!”   He rose in fire and went away south  towards the Running River.      
Chapter X III    NOT AT HOME    In the meanwhile, the dwarves sat in darkness,  and utter silence fell about them. Little they ate  and little they spoke. They could not count the  passing of time; and they scarcely dared to  move, for the whisper of their voices echoed  and rustled in the tunnel. If they dozed, they  woke still to darkness and to silence going on  unbroken. At last after days and days of waiting,  as it seemed, when they were becoming  choked and dazed for want of air, they could  bear it no longer. They would almost have  welcomed sounds from below of the dragon’s  return. In the silence they feared some cunning  devilry of his, but they could not sit there for  ever.   Thorin spoke: “Let us try the door!” he said.  “I must feel the wind on my face soon or die. I  think I would rather be smashed by Smaug in  the open than suffocate in here!” So several of    the dwarves got up and groped back to where  the door had been. But they found that the  upper end of the tunnel had been shattered and  blocked with broken rock. Neither key nor the  magic it had once obeyed would ever open that  door again.   “We are trapped!” they groaned. “This is the  end. We shall die here.”   But somehow, just when the dwarves were  most despairing, Bilbo felt a strange lightening  of the heart, as if a heavyweight had gone from  under his waistcoat.   “Come, come!” he said. ‘“While there’s life  there’s hope!’ as my father used to say, and  Third time pays for all.’ I am going down the  tunnel once again. I have been that way twice,  when I knew there was a dragon at the other  end, so I will risk a third visit when I am no  longer sure. Anyway the only way out is down.  And I think this time you had better all come with  me.”   In desperation they agreed, and Thorin was  the first to go forward by Bilbo’s side.   "Now do be careful!” whispered the hobbit,  “and as quiet as you can be! There may be no  Smaug at the bottom, but then again there may  be. Don’t let us take any unnecessary risks!”   Down, down they went. The dwarves could  not, of course, compare with the hobbit in real     stealth, and they made a deal of puffing and  shuffling which echoes magnified alarmingly;  but though every now and again Bilbo in fear  stopped and listened, not a sound stirred  below. Near the bottom, as well as he could  judge, Bilbo slipped on his ring and went  ahead. But he did not need it: the darkness was  complete, and they were all invisible, ring or no  ring. In fact so black was it that the hobbit came  to the opening unexpectedly, put his hand on  air, stumbled forward, and rolled headlong into  the hall!   There he lay face downwards on the floor  and did not dare to get up, or hardly even to  breathe. But nothing moved. There was not a  gleam of light — unless, as it seemed to him,  when at last he slowly raised his head, there  was a pale white glint, above him and far off in  the gloom. But certainly it was not a spark of  dragon-fire, though the worm-stench was heavy  in the place, and the taste of vapour was on his  tongue.   At length Mr. Baggins could bear it no  longer. “Confound you, Smaug, you worm!” he  squeaked aloud. “Stop playing hide-and-seek!  Give me a light, and then eat me, if you can  catch me!”   Faint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but  there was no answer.     Bilbo got up, and found that he did not know  in what direction to turn.   "Now I wonder what on earth Smaug is  playing at,” he said. “He is not at home today  (or tonight, or whatever it is), I do believe. If Oin  and Gloin have not lost their tinder-boxes,  perhaps we can make a little light, and have a  look round before the luck turns.”   “Light!” he cried. “Can anybody make a  light?”    The dwarves, of course, were very alarmed  when Bilbo fell forward down the step with a  bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just  where he had left them at the end of the tunnel.   “Sh! sh!” they hissed, when they heard his  voice; and though that helped the hobbit to find  out where they were, it was some time before  he could get anything else out of them. But in  the end, when Bilbo actually began to stamp on  the floor, and screamed out “light!” at the top of  his shrill voice, Thorin gave way, and Oin and  Gloin were sent back to their bundles at the top  of the tunnel.   After a while a twinkling gleam showed  them returning, Oin with a small pine-torch alight  in his hand, and Gloin with a bundle of others     under his arm. Quickly Bilbo trotted to the door  and took the torch; but he could not persuade  the dwarves to light the others or to come and  join him yet. As Thorin carefully explained, Mr.  Baggins was still officially their expert burglar  and investigator. If he liked to risk a light, that  was his affair. They would wait in the tunnel for  his report. So they sat near the door and  watched.   They saw the little dark shape of the hobbit  start across the floor holding his tiny light aloft.  Every now and again, while he was still near  enough, they caught a glint and a tinkle as he  stumbled on some golden thing. The light grew  smaller as he wandered away into the vast hall;  then it began to rise dancing into the air. Bilbo  was climbing the great mound of treasure.  Soon he stood upon the top, and still went on.  Then they saw him halt and stoop for a moment;  but they did not know the reason.   It was the Arkenstone, the Heart of the  Mountain. So Bilbo guessed from Thorin’s  description; but indeed there could not be two  such gems, even in so marvellous a hoard,  even in all the world. Ever as he climbed, the  same white gleam had shone before him and  drawn his feet towards it. Slowly it grew to a  little globe of pallid light. Now as he came near,  it was tinged with a flickering sparkle of many     colours at the surface, reflected and splintered  from the wavering light of his torch. At last he  looked down upon it, and he caught his breath.  The great jewel shone before his feet of its own  inner light, and yet, cut and fashioned by the  dwarves, who had dug it from the heart of the  mountain long ago, it took all light that fell upon  it and changed it into ten thousand sparks of  white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow.   Suddenly Bilbo’s arm went towards it drawn  by its enchantment. His small hand would not  close about it, for it was a large and heavy gem;  but he lifted it, shut his eyes, and put it in his  deepest pocket.   "Now I am a burglar indeed!” thought he.  “But I suppose I must tell the dwarves about it —  some time. They did say I could pick and  choose my own share; and I think I would  choose this, if they took all the rest!” All the  same he had an uncomfortable feeling that the  picking and choosing had not really been meant  to include this marvellous gem, and that trouble  would yet come of it.   Now he went on again. Down the other side  of the great mound he climbed, and the spark of  his torch vanished from the sight of the watching  dwarves. But soon they saw it far away in the  distance again. Bilbo was crossing the floor of  the hall.     He went on, until he came to the great  doors at the further side, and there a draught of  air refreshed him, but it almost puffed out his  light. He peeped timidly through, and caught a  glimpse of great passages and of the dim  beginnings of wide stairs going up into the  gloom. And still there was no sight nor sound of  Smaug. He was just going to turn and go back,  when a black shape swooped at him, and  brushed his face. He squeaked and started,  stumbled backwards and fell. His torch dropped  head downwards and went out!   “Only a bat, I suppose and hope!” he said  miserably. “But now what am I to do? Which is  East, South, North, or West?”   “Thorin! Balin! Oin! Gloin! Fili! Kili!” he cried  as loud as he could — it seemed a thin little  noise in the wide blackness. “The light’s gone  out! Someone come and find me and help me!”  For the moment his courage had failed  altogether.   Faintly the dwarves heard his small cries,  though the only word they could catch was  “help!”   “Now what on earth or under it has  happened?” said Thorin. “Certainly not the  dragon, or he would not go on squeaking.”   They waited a moment or two, and still there  were no dragon-noises, no sound at all in fact     but Bilbo’s distant voice. “Come, one of you,  get another light or two!” Thorin ordered. “It  seems we have got to go and help our burglar.”   “It is about our turn to help,” said Balin, “and  I am quite willing to go. Anyway I expect it is  safe for the moment.”   Gloin lit several more torches, and then they  all crept out, one by one, and went along the  wall as hurriedly as they could. It was not long  before they met Bilbo himself coming back  towards them. His wits had quickly returned as  soon as he saw the twinkle of their lights.   “Only a bat and a dropped torch, nothing  worse!” he said in answer to their questions.  Though they were much relieved, they were  inclined to be grumpy at being frightened for  nothing; but what they would have said, if he  had told them at that moment about the  Arkenstone, I don’t know. The mere fleeting  glimpses of treasure which they had caught as  they went along had rekindled all the fire of their  dwarvish hearts; and when the heart of a dwarf,  even the most respectable, is wakened by gold  and by jewels, he grows suddenly bold, and he  may become fierce.   The dwarves indeed no longer needed any  urging. All were now eager to explore the hall  while they had the chance, and willing to believe  that, for the present, Smaug was away from     home. Each now gripped a lighted torch; and  as they gazed, first on one side and then on  another, they forgot fear and even caution. They  spoke aloud, and cried out to one another, as  they lifted old treasures from the mound or from  the wall and held them in the light, caressing  and fingering them.   Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood,  and finding still hanging there many golden  harps strung with silver they took them and  struck them; and being magical (and also  untouched by the dragon, who had small  interest in music) they were still in tune. The  dark hall was filled with a melody that had long  been silent. But most of the dwarves were more  practical: they gathered gems and stuffed their  pockets, and let what they could not carry fall  back through their fingers with a sigh. Thorin  was not least among these; but always he  searched from side to side for something which  he could not find. It was the Arkenstone; but he  spoke of it yet to no one.   Now the dwarves took down mail and  weapons from the walls, and armed  themselves. Royal indeed did Thorin look, clad  in a coat of gold-plated rings, with a silver-  hafted axe in a belt crusted with scarlet stones.   “Mr. Baggins!” he cried. “Here is the first  payment of your reward! Cast off your old coat     and put on this!”   With that he put on Bilbo a small coat of  mail, wrought for some young elf-prince long  ago. It was of silver-steel, which the elves call  mithril, and with it went a belt of pearls and  crystals. A light helm of figured leather,  strengthened beneath with hoops of steel, and  studded about the brim with white gems, was  set upon the hobbit’s head.   “I feel magnificent,” he thought; “but I expect  I look rather absurd. How they would laugh on  the Hill at home! Still I wish there was a looking-  glass handy!”   All the same Mr. Baggins kept his head  more clear of the bewitchment of the hoard than  the dwarves did. Long before the dwarves were  tired of examining the treasures, he became  weary of it and sat down on the floor; and he  began to wonder nervously what the end of it all  would be. “I would give a good many of these  precious goblets,” he thought, “for a drink of  something cheering out of one of Beorn’s  wooden bowls!”   “Thorin!” he cried aloud. “What next? We  are armed, but what good has any armour ever  been before against Smaug the Dreadful? This  treasure is not yet won back. We are not  looking for gold yet, but for a way of escape;  and we have tempted luck too long!”     “You speak the truth!” answered Thorin,  recovering his wits. “Let us go! I will guide you.  Not in a thousand years should I forget the ways  of this palace.” Then he hailed the others, and  they gathered together, and holding their  torches above their heads they passed through  the gaping doors, not without many a backward  glance of longing.   Their glittering mail they had covered again  with their old cloaks and their bright helms with  their tattered hoods, and one by one they  walked behind Thorin, a line of little lights in the  darkness that halted often, listening in fear once  more for any rumour of the dragon’s coming.   Though all the old adornments were long  mouldered or destroyed, and though all was  befouled and blasted with the comings and  goings of the monster, Thorin knew every  passage and every turn. They climbed long  stairs, and turned and went down wide echoing  ways, and turned again and climbed yet more  stairs, and yet more stairs again. These were  smooth, cut out of the living rock broad and fair;  and up, up, the dwarves went, and they met no  sign of any living thing, only furtive shadows that  fled from the approach of their torches fluttering  in the draughts.   The steps were not made, all the same, for  hobbit-legs, and Bilbo was just feeling that he     could go on no longer, when suddenly the roof  sprang high and far beyond the reach of their  torch-light. A white glimmer could be seen  coming through some opening far above, and  the air smelt sweeter. Before them light came  dimly through great doors, that hung twisted on  their hinges and half burnt.   “This is the great chamber of Thror,” said  Thorin; “the hall of feasting and of council. Not  far off now is the Front Gate.”   They passed through the ruined chamber.  Tables were rotting there; chairs and benches  were lying there overturned, charred and  decaying. Skulls and bones were upon the floor  among flagons and bowls and broken drinking-  horns and dust. As they came through yet more  doors at the further end, a sound of water fell  upon their ears, and the grey light grew  suddenly more full.   “There is the birth of the Running River,”  said Thorin. “From here it hastens to the Gate.  Let us follow it!”   Out of a dark opening in a wall of rock there  issued a boiling water, and it flowed swirling in  a narrow channel, carved and made straight  and deep by the cunning of ancient hands.  Beside it ran a stone-paved road, wide enough  for many men abreast. Swiftly along this they  ran, and round a wide-sweeping turn — and     behold! before them stood the broad light of  day. In front there rose a tall arch, still showing  the fragments of old carven work within, worn  and splintered and blackened though it was. A  misty sun sent its pale light between the arms of  the Mountain, and beams of gold fell on the  pavement at the threshold.   A whirl of bats frightened from slumber by  their smoking torches flurried over them; as they  sprang forward their feet slithered on stones  rubbed smooth and slimed by the passing of  the dragon. Now before them the water fell  noisily outward and foamed down towards the  valley. They flung their pale torches to the  ground, and stood gazing out with dazzled  eyes. They were come to the Front Gate, and  were looking out upon Dale.   “Well!” said Bilbo, “I never expected to be  looking out of this door. And I never expected to  be so pleased to see the sun again, and to feel  the wind on my face. But, ow! this wind is cold!”   It was. A bitter easterly breeze blew with a  threat of oncoming winter. It swirled over and  round the arms of the Mountain into the valley,  and sighed among the rocks. After their long  time in the stewing depths of the dragon-  haunted caverns, they shivered in the sun.   Suddenly Bilbo realized that he was not only  tired but also very hungry indeed. “It seems to     be late morning,” he said, ‘‘and so I suppose it  is more or less breakfast-time — if there is any  breakfast to have. But I don’t feel that Smaug’s  front doorstep is the safest place for a meal. Do  let’s go somewhere where we can sit quiet for a  bit!”   “Quite right!” said Balin. “And I think I know  which way we should go: we ought to make for  the old look-out post at the South-West corner  of the Mountain.”   “How far is that?” asked the hobbit.   “Five hours march, I should think. It will be  rough going. The road from the Gate along the  left edge of the stream seems all broken up. But  look down there! The river loops suddenly east  across Dale in front of the ruined town. At that  point there was once a bridge, leading to steep  stairs that climbed up the right bank, and so to  a road running towards Ravenhill. There is (or  was) a path that left the road and climbed up to  the post. A hard climb, too, even if the old steps  are still there.”   “Dear me!” grumbled the hobbit. “More  walking and more climbing without breakfast! I  wonder how many breakfasts, and other meals,  we have missed inside that nasty clockless,  timeless hole?”   As a matter of fact two nights and the day  between had gone by (and not altogether     without food) since the dragon smashed the  magic door, but Bilbo had quite lost count, and  it might have been one night or a week of nights  for all he could tell.   “Come, come!” said Thorin laughing — his  spirits had begun to rise again, and he rattled  the precious stones in his pockets. “Don’t call  my palace a nasty hole! You wait till it has been  cleaned and redecorated!”   “That won’t be till Smaug’s dead,” said  Bilbo glumly. “In the meanwhile where is he? I  would give a good breakfast to know. I hope he  is not up on the Mountain looking down at us!”   That idea disturbed the dwarves mightily,  and they quickly decided that Bilbo and Balin  were right.   “We must move away from here,” said Dori.  “I feel as if his eyes were on the back of my  head.”   “It’s a cold lonesome place,” said Bombur.  “There may be drink, but I see no sign of food.  A dragon would always be hungry in such  parts.”   “Come on! Come on!” cried the others. “Let  us follow Balin’s path!”    Under the rocky wall to the right there was no     path, so on they trudged among the stones on  the left side of the river, and the emptiness and  desolation soon sobered even Thorin again.  The bridge that Balin had spoken of they found  long fallen, and most of its stones were now  only boulders in the shallow noisy stream; but  they forded the water without much difficulty,  and found the ancient steps, and climbed the  high bank. After going a short way they struck  the old road, and before long came to a deep  dell sheltered among the rocks; there they  rested for a while and had such a breakfast as  they could, chiefly cram and water. (If you want  to know what cram is, I can only say that I don’t  know the recipe; but it is biscuitish, keeps good  indefinitely, is supposed to be sustaining, and  is certainly not entertaining, being in fact very  uninteresting except as a chewing exercise. It  was made by the Lake-men for long journeys.)   After that they went on again; and now the  road struck westwards and left the river, and the  great shoulder of the south-pointing mountain-  spur drew ever nearer. At length they reached  the hill path. It scrambled steeply up, and they  plodded slowly one behind the other, till at last  in the late afternoon they came to the top of the  ridqe and saw the wintry sun qoinq downwards  to the West.   Here they found a flat place without a wall     on three sides, but backed to the North by a  rocky face in which there was an opening like a  door. From that door there was a wide view  East and South and West.   “Here,” said Balin, “in the old days we used  always to keep watchmen, and that door behind  leads into a rockhewn chamber that was made  here as a guardroom. There were several  places like it round the Mountain. But there  seemed small need for watching in the days of  our prosperity, and the guards were made over  comfortable, perhaps — otherwise we might  have had longer warning of the coming of the  dragon, and things might have been different.  Still, here we can now lie hid and sheltered for a  while, and can see much without being seen.”   "Not much use, if we have been seen  coming here,” said Dori, who was always  looking up towards the Mountain’s peak, as if  he expected to see Smaug perched there like a  bird on a steeple.   “We must take our chance of that,” said  Thorin. “We can go no further to-day.”   “Hear, hear!” cried Bilbo, and flung himself  on the ground.   In the rock-chamber there would have been  room for a hundred, and there was a small  chamber further in, more removed from the cold  outside. It was quite deserted; not even wild     animals seemed to have used it in all the days  of Smaug’s dominion. There they laid their  burdens; and some threw themselves down at  once and slept, but the others sat near the outer  door and discussed their plans. In all their talk  they came perpetually back to one thing: where  was Smaug? They looked West and there was  nothing, and East there was nothing, and in the  South there was no sign of the dragon, but there  was a gathering of very many birds. At that they  gazed and wondered; but they were no nearer  understanding it, when the first cold stars came  out.      
Chapter XIV    FIRE AND WATER    Now if you wish, like the dwarves, to hear news  of Smaug, you must go back again to the  evening when he smashed the door and flew off  in rage, two days before.   The men of the lake-town Esgaroth were  mostly indoors, for the breeze was from the  black East and chill, but a few were walking on  the quays, and watching, as they were fond of  doing, the stars shine out from the smooth  patches of the lake as they opened in the sky.  From their town the Lonely Mountain was mostly  screened by the low hills at the far end of the  lake, through a gap in which the Running River  came down from the North. Only its high peak  could they see in clear weather, and they  looked seldom at it, for it was ominous and  drear even in the light of morning. Now it was  lost and gone, blotted in the dark.   Suddenly it flickered back to view; a brief    glow touched it and faded.   “Look!” said one. “The lights again! Last  night the watchmen saw them start and fade  from midnight until dawn. Something is  happening up there.”   “Perhaps the King under the Mountain is  forging gold,” said another. “It is long since he  went North. It is time the songs began to prove  themselves again.”   “Which king?” said another with a grim  voice. “As like as not it is the marauding fire of  the Dragon, the only king under the Mountain  we have ever known.”   “You are always foreboding gloomy things!”  said the others. “Anything from floods to  poisoned fish. Think of something cheerful!”   Then suddenly a great light appeared in the  low place in the hills and the northern end of the  lake turned golden. “The King beneath the  Mountain!” they shouted. “His wealth is like the  Sun, his silver like a fountain, his rivers golden  run! The river is running gold from the  Mountain!” they cried, and everywhere windows  were opening and feet were hurrying.   There was once more a tremendous  excitement and enthusiasm. But the grim-  voiced fellow ran hotfoot to the Master. “The  dragon is coming or I am a fool!” he cried. “Cut  the bridges! To arms! To arms!”     Then warning trumpets were suddenly  sounded, and echoed along the rocky shores.  The cheering stopped and the joy was turned to  dread. So it was that the dragon did not find  them quite unprepared.   Before long, so great was his speed, they  could see him as a spark of fire rushing  towards them and growing ever huger and  more bright, and not the most foolish doubted  that the prophecies had gone rather wrong. Still  they had a little time. Every vessel in the town  was filled with water, every warrior was armed,  every arrow and dart was ready, and the bridge  to the land was thrown down and destroyed,  before the roar of Smaug’s terrible approach  grew loud, and the lake rippled red as fire  beneath the awful beating of his wings.   Amid shrieks and wailing and the shouts of  men he came over them, swept towards the  bridges and was foiled! The bridge was gone,  and his enemies were on an island in deep  water — too deep and dark and cool for his  liking. If he plunged into it, a vapour and a  steam would arise enough to cover all the land  with a mist for days; but the lake was mightier  than he, it would quench him before he could  pass through.   Roaring he swept back over the town. A hail  of dark arrows leaped up and snapped and     rattled on his scales and jewels, and their shafts  fell back kindled by his breath burning and  hissing into the lake. No fireworks you ever  imagined equalled the sights that night. At the  twanging of the bows and the shrilling of the  trumpets the dragon’s wrath blazed to its height,  till he was blind and mad with it. No one had  dared to give battle to him for many an age; nor  would they have dared now, if it had not been  for the grim-voiced man (Bard was his name),  who ran to and fro cheering on the archers and  urging the Master to order them to fight to the  last arrow.   Fire leaped from the dragon’s jaws. He  circled for a while high in the air above them  lighting all the lake; the trees by the shores  shone like copper and like blood with leaping  shadows of dense black at their feet. Then  down he swooped straight through the arrow-  storm, reckless in his rage, taking no heed to  turn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking  only to set their town ablaze.   Fire leaped from thatched roofs and  wooden beam-ends as he hurtled down and  past and round again, though all had been  drenched with water before he came. Once  more water was flung by a hundred hands  wherever a spark appeared. Back swirled the  dragon. A sweep of his tail and the roof of the     Great House crumbled and smashed down.  Flames unquenchable sprang high into the  night. Another swoop and another, and another  house and then another sprang afire and fell;  and still no arrow hindered Smaug or hurt him  more than a fly from the marshes.    Already men were jumping into the water on  every side. Women and children were being  huddled into laden boats in the market-pool.  Weapons were flung down. There was  mourning and weeping, where but a little time  ago the old songs of mirth to come had been  sung about the dwarves. Now men cursed their  names. The Master himself was turning to his  great gilded boat, hoping to row away in the  confusion and save himself. Soon all the town  would be deserted and burned down to the  surface of the lake.   That was the dragon’s hope. They could all  get into boats for all he cared. There he could  have fine sport hunting them, or they could stop  till they starved. Let them try to get to land and  he would be ready. Soon he would set all the  shoreland woods ablaze and wither every field  and pasture. Just now he was enjoying the sport  of town-baiting more than he had enjoyed     anything for years.   But there was still a company of archers  that held their ground among the burning  houses. Their captain was Bard, grim-voiced  and grim-faced, whose friends had accused  him of prophesying floods and poisoned fish,  though they knew his worth and courage. He  was a descendant in long line of Girion, Lord of  Dale, whose wife and child had escaped down  the Running River from the ruin long ago. Now  he shot with a great yew bow, till all his arrows  but one were spent. The flames were near him.  His companions were leaving him. He bent his  bow for the last time.   S ud d e nly o ut of the d a rk so methi ng fl utte red  to his shoulder. He started — but it was only an  old thrush. Unafraid it perched by his ear and it  brought him news. Marvelling he found he could  understand its tongue, for he was of the race of  Dale.   “Wait! Wait!” it said to him. “The moon is  rising. Look for the hollow of the left breast as  he flies and turns above you!” And while Bard  paused in wonder it told him of tidings up in the  Mountain and of all that it had heard.   Then Bard drew his bow-string to his ear.  The dragon was circling back, flying low, and as  he came the moon rose above the eastern  shore and silvered his great wings.     “Arrow!” said the bowman. “Black arrow! I  have saved you to the last. You have never  failed me and always I have recovered you. I  had you from my father and he from of old. If  ever you came from the forges of the true king  under the Mountain, go nowand speed well!”   The dragon swooped once more lower than  ever, and as he turned and dived down his belly  glittered white with sparkling fires of gems in  the moon — but not in one place. The great bow  twanged. The black arrow sped straight from  the string, straight for the hollow by the left  breast where the foreleg was flung wide. In it  smote and vanished, barb, shaft and feather, so  fierce was its flight. With a shriek that deafened  men, felled trees and split stone, Smaug shot  spouting into the air, turned over and crashed  down from on high in ruin.   Full on the town he fell. His last throes  splintered it to sparks and gledes. The lake  roared in. A vast steam leaped up, white in the  sudden dark under the moon. There was a hiss,  a gushing whirl, and then silence. And that was  the end of Smaug and Esgaroth, but not of  Bard.    The waxing moon rose higher and higher and     the wind grew loud and cold. It twisted the white  fog into bending pillars and hurrying clouds and  drove it off to the West to scatter in tattered  shreds over the marshes before Mirkwood.  Then the many boats could be seen dotted dark  on the surface of the lake, and down the wind  came the voices of the people of Esgaroth  lamenting their lost town and goods and ruined  houses. But they had really much to be thankful  for, had they thought of it, though it could hardly  be expected that they should just then: three  quarters of the people of the town had at least  escaped alive; their woods and fields and  pastures and cattle and most of their boats  remained undamaged; and the dragon was  dead. What that meant they had not yet  realized.   They gathered in mournful crowds upon the  western shores, shivering in the cold wind, and  their first complaints and anger were against  the Master, who had left the town so soon, while  some were still willing to defend it.   “He may have a good head for business —  especially his own business,” some murmured,  “but he is no good when anything serious  happens!” And they praised the courage of  Bard and his last mighty shot. “If only he had not  been killed,” they all said, “we would make him  a king. Bard the Dragon-shooter of the line of     Girion! Alas that he is lost!”   And in the very midst of theirtalk a tall figure  stepped from the shadows. He was drenched  with water, his black hair hung wet over his face  and shoulders, and a fierce light was in his  eyes.   “Bard is not lost!” he cried. “He dived from  Esgaroth, when the enemy was slain. I am  Bard, of the line of Girion; I am the slayer of the  dragon!”   “King Bard! King Bard!” they shouted; but  the Master ground his chattering teeth.   “Girion was lord of Dale, not king of  Esgaroth,” he said. “In the Lake-town we have  always elected masters from among the old  and wise, and have not endured the rule of  mere fighting men. Let ‘King Bard’ go back to  his own kingdom — Dale is now freed by his  valour, and nothing hinders his return. And any  that wish can go with him, if they prefer the cold  stones under the shadow of the Mountain to the  green shores of the lake. The wise will stay here  and hope to rebuild our town, and enjoy again in  time its peace and riches.”   “We will have King Bard!” the people near  at hand shouted in reply. “We have had enough  of the old men and the money-counters!” And  people further off took up the cry: “Up the  Bowman, and down with Moneybags,” till the     clamour echoed along the shore.   “I am the last man to undervalue Bard the  Bowman,” said the Master warily (for Bard now  stood close beside him). “He has tonight  earned an eminent place in the roll of the  benefactors of our town; and he is worthy of  many imperishable songs. But, why O  People?” — and here the Master rose to his feet  and spoke very loud and clear — “Why do I get  all your blame? For what fault am I to be  deposed? Who aroused the dragon from his  slumber, I might ask? Who obtained of us rich  gifts and ample help, and led us to believe that  old songs could come true? Who played on our  soft hearts and our pleasant fancies? What sort  of gold have they sent down the river to reward  us? Dragon-fire and ruin! From whom should  we claim the recompense of our damage, and  aid for our widows and orphans?”   As you see, the Master had not got his  position for nothing. The result of his words was  that for the moment the people quite forgot their  idea of a new king, and turned their angry  thoughts towards Thorin and his company. Wild  and bitter words were shouted from many  sides; and some of those who had before sung  the old songs loudest, were now heard as loudly  crying that the dwarves had stirred the dragon  up against them deliberately!     “Fools!” said Bard. “Why waste words and  wrath on those unhappy creatures? Doubtless  they perished first in fire, before Smaug came  to us.” Then even as he was speaking, the  thought came into his heart of the fabled  treasure of the Mountain lying without guard or  owner, and he fell suddenly silent. He thought of  the Master’s words, and of Dale rebuilt, and  filled with golden bells, if he could but find the  men.   At length he spoke again: “This is no time  for angry words, Master, or for considering  weighty plans of change. There is work to do. I  serve you still — though after a while I may think  again of your words and go North with any that  will follow me.”   Then he strode off to help in the ordering of  the camps and in the care of the sick and the  wounded. But the Master scowled at his back  as he went, and remained sitting on the ground.  He thought much but said little, unless it was to  call loudly for men to bring him fire and food.   Now everywhere Bard went he found talk  running like fire among the people concerning  the vast treasure that was now unguarded. Men  spoke of the recompense for all their harm that  they would soon get from it, and wealth over  and to spare with which to buy rich things from  the South; and it cheered them greatly in their     plight. That was as well, for the night was bitter  and miserable. Shelters could be contrived for  few (the Master had one) and there was little  food (even the Master went short). Many took ill  of wet and cold and sorrow that night, and  afterwards died, who had escaped uninjured  from the ruin of the town; and in the days that  followed there was much sickness and great  hunger.   Meanwhile Bard took the lead, and ordered  things as he wished, though always in the  Master’s name, and he had a hard task to  govern the people and direct the preparations  for their protection and housing. Probably most  of them would have perished in the winter that  now hurried after autumn, if help had not been  to hand. But help came swiftly; for Bard at once  had speedy messengers sent up the river to the  Forest to ask the aid of the King of the Elves of  the Wood, and these messengers had found a  host already on the move, although it was then  only the third day after the fall of Smaug.   The Elvenking had received news from his  own messengers and from the birds that loved  his folk, and already knew much of what had  happened. Very great indeed was the  commotion among all things with wings that  dwelt on the borders of the Desolation of the  Dragon. The air was filled with circling flocks,     and their swift-flying messengers flew here and  there across the sky. Above the borders of the  Forest there was whistling, crying and piping.  Far over Mirkwood tidings spread: “Smaug is  dead!” Leaves rustled and startled ears were  lifted. Even before the Elvenking rode forth the  news had passed west right to the pinewoods  of the Misty Mountains; Beorn had heard it in  his wooden house, and the goblins were at  council in their caves.   “That will be the last we shall hear of Thorin  Oakenshield, I fear,” said the king. “He would  have done better to have remained my guest. It  is an ill wind, all the same,” he added, “that  blows no one any good.” For he too had not  forgotten the legend of the wealth of Thror. So it  was that Bard’s messengers found him now  marching with many spearmen and bowmen;  and crows were gathered thick above him, for  they thought that war was awakening again,  such as had not been in those parts for a long  age.   But the king, when he received the prayers  of Bard, had pity, for he was the lord of a good  and kindly people; so turning his march, which  had at first been direct towards the Mountain,  he hastened now down the river to the Long  Lake. He had not boats or rafts enough for his  host, and they were forced to go the slower way     by foot; but great store of goods he sent ahead  by water. Still elves are light-footed, and though  they were not in these days much used to the  marches and the treacherous lands between  the Forest and the Lake, their going was swift.  Only five days after the death of the dragon they  came upon the shores and looked on the ruins  of the town. Their welcome was good, as may  be expected, and the men and their Master  were ready to make any bargain for the future in  return for the Elvenking’s aid.   Their plans were soon made. With the  women and the children, the old and the unfit,  the Master remained behind; and with him were  some men of crafts and many skilled elves; and  they busied themselves felling trees, and  collecting the timber sent down from the Forest.  Then they set about raising many huts by the  shore against the oncoming winter; and also  under the Master’s direction they began the  planning of a new town, designed more fair and  large even than before, but not in the same  place. They removed northward higher up the  shore; for ever after they had a dread of the  water where the dragon lay. He would never  again return to his golden bed, but was  stretched cold as stone, twisted upon the floor  of the shallows. There for ages his huge bones  could be seen in calm weather amid the ruined     piles of the old town. But few dared to cross the  cursed spot, and none dared to dive into the  shivering water or recover the precious stones  that fell from his rotting carcase.   But all the men of arms who were still able,  and the most of the Elvenking’s array, got ready  to march north to the Mountain. It was thus that  in eleven days from the ruin of the town the  head of their host passed the rock-gates at the  end of the lake and came into the desolate  lands.      
Chapter XV    THE GATHERING OF THE   CLOUDS    Now we will return to Bilbo and the dwarves. All  night one of them had watched, but when  morning came they had not heard or seen any  sign of danger. But ever more thickly the birds  were gathering. Their companies came flying  from the South; and the crows that still lived  about the Mountain were wheeling and crying  unceasingly above.   “Something strange is happening,” said  Thorin. “The time has gone for the autumn  wanderings; and these are birds that dwell  always in the land; there are starlings and flocks  of finches; and far off there are many carrion  birds as if a battle were afoot!”   Suddenly Bilbo pointed: “There is that old  thrush again!” he cried. “He seems to have  escaped, when Smaug smashed the mountain-  side, but I don’t suppose the snails have!”    Sure enough the old thrush was there, and  as Bilbo pointed, he flew towards them and  perched on a stone near by. Then he fluttered  his wings and sang; then he cocked his head  on one side, as if to listen; and again he sang,  and again he listened.   “I believe he is trying to tell us something,”  said Balin; ‘‘but I cannot follow the speech of  such birds, it is very quick and difficult. Can you  make it out Baggins?”   "Not very well,” said Bilbo (as a matter of  fact, he could make nothing of it at all); “but the  old fellow seems very excited.”   “I only wish he was a raven!” said Balin.   “I thought you did not like them! You  seemed very shy of them, when we came this  way before.”   “Those were crows! And nasty suspicious-  looking creatures at that, and rude as well. You  must have heard the ugly names they were  calling after us. But the ravens are different.  There used to be great friendship between  them and the people of Thror; and they often  brought us secret news, and were rewarded  with such bright things as they coveted to hide  in their dwellings.   “They live many a year, and their memories  are long, and they hand on their wisdom to their  children. I knew many among the ravens of the     rocks when I was a dwarf-lad. This very height  was once named Ravenhill, because there was  a wise and famous pair, old Care and his wife,  that lived here above the guard-chamber. But I  don’t suppose that any of that ancient breed  linger here now.”   No sooner had he finished speaking than  the old thrush gave a loud call, and immediately  flew away.   “We may not understand him, but that old  bird understands us, I am sure,” said Balin.  “Keep watch now, and see what happens!”   Before long there was a fluttering of wings,  and back came the thrush; and with him came a  most decrepit old bird. He was getting blind, he  could hardly fly, and the top of his head was  bald. He was an aged raven of great size. He  alighted stiffly on the ground before them, slowly  flapped his wings, and bobbed towards Thorin.   “O Thorin son of Thrain, and Balin son of  Fundin,” he croaked (and Bilbo could  understand what he said, for he used ordinary  language and not bird-speech). “I am Roac son  of Care. Care is dead, but he was well known to  you once. It is a hundred years and three and  fifty since I came out of the egg, but I do not  forget what my father told me. Now I am the  chief of the great ravens of the Mountain. We  are few, but we remember still the king that was     of old. Most of my people are abroad, for there  are great tidings in the South — some are  tidings of joy to you, and some you will not think  so good.   “Behold! the birds are gathering back again  to the Mountain and to Dale from South and  East and West, for word has gone out that  Smaug is dead!”   “Dead! Dead?” shouted the dwarves.  “Dead! Then we have been in needless fear —  and the treasure is ours!” They all sprang up  and began to caper about for joy.   “Yes, dead,” said Roac. “The thrush, may  his feathers never fall, saw him die, and we may  trust his words. He saw him fall in battle with the  men of Esgaroth the third night back from now  at the rising of the moon.”   It was some time before Thorin could bring  the dwarves to be silent and listen to the raven’s  news. At length when he had told all the tale of  the battle he went on:   “So much for joy, Thorin Oakenshield. You  may go back to your halls in safety; all the  treasure is yours — for the moment. But many  are gathering hither beside the birds. The news  of the death of the guardian has already gone  far and wide, and the legend of the wealth of  Thror has not lost in the telling during many  years; many are eager for a share of the spoil.     Already a host of the elves is on the way, and  carrion birds are with them hoping for battle and  slaughter. By the lake men murmur that their  sorrows are due to the dwarves; for they are  homeless and many have died, and Smaug has  destroyed their town. They too think to find  amends from your treasure, whether you are  alive or dead.   “Your own wisdom must decide your  course; but thirteen is small remnant of the  great folk of Durin that once dwelt here, and  now are scattered far. If you will listen to my  counsel, you will not trust the Master of the  Lake-men, but rather him that shot the dragon  with his bow. Bard is he, of the race of Dale, of  the line of Girion; he is a grim man but true. We  would see peace once more among dwarves  and men and elves after the long desolation; but  it may cost you dear in gold. I have spoken.”   Then Thorin burst forth in anger: “Our  thanks, Roac Care’s son. You and your people  shall not be forgotten. But none of our gold shall  thieves take or the violent carry off while we are  alive. If you would earn our thanks still more,  bring us news of any that draw near. Also I  would beg of you, if any of you are still young  and strong of wing, that you would send  messengers to our kin in the mountains of the  North, both west from here and east, and tell     them of our plight. But go specially to my cousin  Dain in the Iron Hills, for he has many people  well-armed, and dwells nearest to this place.  Bid him hasten!”   “I will not say if this counsel be good or  bad,” croaked Roac, “but I will do what can be  done.” Then off he slowly flew.   “Back now to the Mountain!” cried Thorin.  “We have little time to lose.”   “And little food to use!” cried Bilbo, always  practical on such points. In any case he felt that  the adventure was, properly speaking, over with  the death of the dragon — in which he was much  mistaken — and he would have given most of his  share of the profits for the peaceful winding up  of these affairs.   “Back to the Mountain!” cried the dwarves  as if they had not heard him; so back he had to  go with them.    As you have heard some of the events already,  you will see that the dwarves still had some  days before them. They explored the caverns  once more, and found, as they expected, that  only the Front Gate remained open; all the other  gates (except, of course, the small secret door)  had long ago been broken and blocked by     Smaug, and no sign of them remained. So now  they began to labour hard in fortifying the main  entrance, and in making a new path that led  from it. Tools were to be found in plenty that the  miners and quarriers and builders of old had  used; and at such work the dwarves were still  very skilled.   As they worked the ravens brought them  constant tidings. In this way they learned that the  Elvenking had turned aside to the Lake, and  they still had a breathing space. Better still, they  heard that three of their ponies had escaped  and were wandering wild far down the banks of  the Running River, not far from where the rest of  their stores had been left. So while the others  went on with their work, Fili and Kili were sent,  guided by a raven, to find the ponies and bring  back all they could.   They were four days gone, and by that time  they knew that the joined armies of the Lake-  men and the Elves were hurrying toward the  Mountain. But now their hopes were higher; for  they had food for some weeks with care —  chiefly cram, of course, and they were very tired  of it; but cram is much better than nothing — and  already the gate was blocked with a wall of  squared stones laid dry, but very thick and high,  across the opening. There were holes in the  wall through which they could see (or shoot), but     no entrance. They climbed in or out with  ladders, and hauled stuff up with ropes. For the  issuing of the stream they had contrived a small  low arch under the new wall; but near the  entrance they had so altered the narrow bed  that a wide pool stretched from the mountain-  wall to the head of the fall over which the stream  went towards Dale. Approach to the Gate was  now only possible, without swimming, along a  narrow ledge of the cliff, to the right as one  looked outwards from the wall. The ponies they  had brought only to the head of the steps above  the old bridge, and unloading them there had  bidden them return to their masters and sent  them back riderless to the South.    There came a night when suddenly there were  many lights as of fires and torches away south  in Dale before them.   “They have come!” called Balin. “And their  camp is very great. They must have come into  the valley under the cover of dusk along both  banks of the river.”   That night the dwarves slept little. The  morning was still pale when they saw a  company approaching. From behind their wall  they watched them come up to the valley’s head     and climb slowly up. Before long they could see  that both men of the lake armed as if for war  and elvish bowmen were among them. At length  the foremost of these climbed the tumbled  rocks and appeared at the top of the falls; and  very great was their surprise to see the pool  before them and the Gate blocked with a wall of  new-hewn stone.   As they stood pointing and speaking to one  another Thorin hailed them: “Who are you,” he  called in a very loud voice, “that come as if in  war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King  under the Mountain, and what do you desire?”   But they answered nothing. Some turned  swiftly back, and the others after gazing for a  while at the Gate and its defences soon  followed them. That day the camp was moved  to the east of the river, right between the arms  of the Mountain. The rocks echoed then with  voices and with song, as they had not done for  many a day. There was the sound, too, of elven-  harps and of sweet music; and as it echoed up  towards them it seemed that the chill of the air  was warmed, and they caught faintly the  fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in  spring.   Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark  fortress and to go down and join in the mirth  and feasting by the fires. Some of the younger     dwarves were moved in their hearts, too, and  they muttered that they wished things had fallen  out otherwise and that they might welcome such  folk as friends; but Thorin scowled.   Then the dwarves themselves brought forth  harps and instruments regained from the hoard,  and made music to soften his mood; but their  song was not as elvish song, and was much like  the song they had sung long before in Bilbo’s  little hobbit-hole.    Under the Mountain dark and tall  The King has come unto his hall!  His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread,  And ever so his foes shall fall.    The sword is sharp, the spear is long,  The arrow swift, the Gate is strong;   The heart is bold that looks on gold;   The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.    The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,  While hammers fell like ringing bells     In places deep, where dark things sleep,  In hollowhalls beneath the fells.    On silver necklaces they strung  The light of stars, on crowns they hung  The dragon-fire, from twisted wire  The melody of harps they wrung.    The mountain throne once more is freed!  O! wandering folk, the summons heed!  Come haste! Come haste! across the  waste!   The king of friend and kin has need.    Now cal I we over mountains cold,  ‘Come back unto the caverns old’!  Here at the Gates the king awaits,   His hands are rich with gems and gold.     The king is come unto his hall  Under the Mountain dark and tall.   The Worm of Dread is slain and dead,  And ever so our foes shall fall!    This song appeared to please Thorin, and  he smiled again and grew merry; and he began  reckoning the distance to the Iron Hills and how  long it would be before Dain could reach the  Lonely Mountain, if he had set out as soon as  the message reached him. But Bilbo’s heart  fell, both at the song and the talk: they sounded  much too warlike.   The next morning early a company of  spearmen was seen crossing the river, and  marching up the valley. They bore with them the  green banner of the Elvenking and the blue  banner of the Lake, and they advanced until  they stood right before the wall at the Gate.   Again Thorin hailed them in a loud voice:  “Who are you that come armed for war to the  gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the  Mountain?” This time he was answered.   A tall man stood forward, dark of hair and  grim of face, and he cried: “Hail Thorin! Why do  you fence yourself like a robber in his hold? We  are not yet foes, and we rejoice that you are  alive beyond our hope. We came expecting to     find none living here; yet now that we are met  there is matter for a parley and a council.”   “Who are you, and of what would you  parley?”   “I am Bard, and by my hand was the dragon  slain and your treasure delivered. Is that not a  matter that concerns you? Moreover I am by  right descent the heir of Girion of Dale, and in  your hoard is mingled much of the wealth of his  halls and towns, which of old Smaug stole. Is  not that a matter of which we may speak?  Further in his last battle Smaug destroyed the  dwellings of the men of Esgaroth, and I am yet  the servant of their Master. I would speak for  him and ask whether you have no thought for  the sorrow and misery of his people. They  aided you in your distress, and in recompense  you have thus far brought ruin only, though  doubtless undesigned.”   Now these were fair words and true, if  proudly and grimly spoken; and Bilbo thought  that Thorin would at once admit what justice  was in them. He did not, of course, expect that  any one would remember that it was he who  discovered all by himself the dragon’s weak  spot; and that was just as well, for no one ever  did. But also he did not reckon with the power  that gold has upon which a dragon has long  brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts. Long hours    in the past days Thorin had spent in the  treasury, and the lust of it was heavy on him.  Though he had hunted chiefly for the  Arkenstone, yet he had an eye for many another  wonderful thing that was lying there, about which  were wound old memories of the labours and  the sorrows of his race.   “You put your worst cause last and in the  chief place,” Thorin answered. “To the treasure  of my people no man has a claim, because  Smaug who stole it from us also robbed him of  life or home. The treasure was not his that his  evil deeds should be amended with a share of  it. The price of the goods and the assistance  that we received of the Lake-men we will fairly  pay — in due time. But nothing will we give, not  even a loafs worth, under threat offeree. While  an armed host lies before our doors, we look on  you as foes and thieves.   “It is in my mind to ask what share of their  inheritance you would have paid to our kindred,  had you found the hoard unguarded and us  slain.”   “A just question,” replied Bard. “But you are  not dead, and we are not robbers. Moreover the  wealthy may have pity beyond right on the  needy that befriended them when they were in  want. And still my other claims remain    unanswered.”   “I will not parley, as I have said, with armed  men at my gate. Nor at all with the people of the  Elvenking, whom I remember with small  kindness. In this debate they have no place.  Begone now ere our arrows fly! And if you  would speak with me again, first dismiss the  elvish host to the woods where it belongs, and  then return, laying down your arms before you  approach the threshold.”   “The Elvenking is my friend, and he has  succoured the people of the Lake in their need,  though they had no claim but friendship on him,”  answered Bard. “We will give you time to repent  your words. Gather your wisdom ere we return!”  Then he departed and went back to the camp.   Ere many hours were past, the banner-  bearers returned, and trumpeters stood forth  and blew a blast:   “In the name of Esgaroth and the Forest,”  one cried, “we speak unto Thorin Thrain’s son  Oakenshield, calling himself the King under the  Mountain, and we bid him consider well the  claims that have been urged, or be declared  our foe. At the least he shall deliver one twelfth  portion of the treasure unto Bard, as the  dragon-slayer, and as the heir of Girion. From  that portion Bard will himself contribute to the  aid of Esgaroth; but if Thorin would have the     friendship and honour of the lands about, as his  sires had of old, then he will give also  somewhat of his own for the comfort of the men  of the Lake.”   Then Thorin seized a bow of horn and shot  an arrow at the speaker. It smote into his shield  and stuck there quivering.   “Since such is your answer,” he called in  return, “I declare the Mountain besieged. You  shall not depart from it, until you call on your  side for a truce and a parley. We will bear no  weapons against you, but we leave you to your  gold. You may eat that, if you will!”   With that the messengers departed swiftly,  and the dwarves were left to consider their  case. So grim had Thorin become, that even if  they had wished, the others would not have  dared to find fault with him; but indeed most of  them seemed to share his mind — except  perhaps old fat Bomburand Fili and Kili. Bilbo,  of course, disapproved of the whole turn of  affairs. He had by now had more than enough of  the Mountain, and being besieged inside it was  not at all to his taste.   “The whole place still stinks of dragon,” he  grumbled to himself, “and it makes me sick.  And cram is beginning simply to stick in my  throat.”       
Chapter XVI    A THIEF IN THE NIGHT    Now the days passed slowly and wearily. Many  of the dwarves spent their time piling and  ordering the treasure; and now Thorin spoke of  the Arkenstone of Thrain, and bade them  eagerly to look for it in every corner.   “For the Arkenstone of my father,” he said,  “is worth more than a river of gold in itself, and  to me it is beyond price. That stone of all the  treasure I name unto myself, and I will be  avenged on anyone who finds it and withholds  it.”   Bilbo heard these words and he grew  afraid, wondering what would happen, if the  stone was found — wrapped in an old bundle of  tattered oddments that he used as a pillow. All  the same he did not speak of it, for as the  weariness of the days grew heavier, the  beginnings of a plan had come into his little  head.    Things had gone on like this for some time,  when the ravens brought news that Dain and  more than five hundred dwarves, hurrying from  the Iron Hills, were now within about two days’  march of Dale, coming from the North-East.   “But they cannot reach the Mountain  unmarked,” said Roac, “and I fear lest there be  battle in the valley. I do not call this counsel  good. Though they are a grim folk, they are not  likely to overcome the host that besets you; and  even if they did so, what will you gain? Winter  and snow is hastening behind them. How shall  you be fed without the friendship and goodwill  of the lands about you? The treasure is likely to  be your death, though the dragon is no more!”   But Thorin was not moved. “Winter and  snow will bite both men and elves,” he said,  “and they may find their dwelling in the waste  grievous to bear. With my friends behind them  and winter upon them, they will perhaps be in  softer mood to parley with.”   That night Bilbo made up his mind. The sky  was black and moonless. As soon as it was full  dark, he went to a corner of an inner chamber  just within the gate and drew from his bundle a  rope, and also the Arkenstone wrapped in a  rag. Then he climbed to the top of the wall. Only  Bombur was there, for it was his turn to watch,  and the dwarves kept only one watchman at a     time.   “It is mighty cold!” said Bombur. “I wish we  could have a fire up here as they have in the  camp!”   “It is warm enough inside,” said Bilbo.   “I daresay; but I am bound here till  midnight,” grumbled the fat dwarf. “A sorry  business altogether. Not that I venture to  disagree with Thorin, may his beard grow ever  longer; yet he was ever a dwarf with a stiff  neck.”   "Not as stiff as my legs,” said Bilbo. “I am  tired of stairs and stone passages. I would give  a good deal for the feel of grass at my toes.”   “I would give a good deal for the feel of a  strong drink in my throat, and for a soft bed after  a good supper!”   “I can’t give you those, while the siege is  going on. But it is long since I watched, and I will  take your turn for you, if you like. There is no  sleep in me tonight.”   “You are a good fellow, Mr. Baggins, and I  will take your offer kindly. If there should be  anything to note, rouse me first, mind you! I will  lie in the inner chamber to the left, not far away.”   “Off you go!” said Bilbo. “I will wake you at  midnight, and you can wake the next  watchman.”   As soon as Bombur had gone, Bilbo put on     his ring, fastened his rope, slipped down over  the wall, and was gone. He had about five hours  before him. Bombur would sleep (he could  sleep at any time, and ever since the adventure  in the forest he was always trying to recapture  the beautiful dreams he had then); and all the  others were busy with Thorin. It was unlikely that  any, even Fili or Kili, would come out on the wall  until it was their turn.   It was very dark, and the road after a while,  when he left the newly made path and climbed  down towards the lower course of the stream,  was strange to him. At last he came to the bend  where he had to cross the water, if he was to  make for the camp, as he wished. The bed of  the stream was there shallow but already broad,  and fording it in the dark was not easy for the  little hobbit. He was nearly across when he  missed his footing on a round stone and fell into  the cold water with a splash. He had barely  scrambled out on the far bank, shivering and  spluttering, when up came elves in the gloom  with bright lanterns and searched for the cause  of the noise.   “That was no fish!” one said. “There is a spy  about. Hide your lights! They will help him more  than us, if it is that queer little creature that is  said to be their servant.”   “Servant, indeed!” snorted Bilbo; and in the     middle of his snort he sneezed loudly, and the  elves immediately gathered towards the sound.   “Let’s have a light!” he said. “I am here, if  you want me!” and he slipped off his ring, and  popped from behind a rock.   They seized him quickly, in spite of their  surprise. “Who are you? Are you the dwarves’  hobbit? What are you doing? How did you get  so far past our sentinels?” they asked one after  another.   “I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins,” he answered,  “companion of Thorin, if you want to know. I  know your king well by sight, though perhaps he  doesn’t know me to look at. But Bard will  remember me, and it is Bard I particularly want  to see.”   “Indeed!” said they, “and what may be your  business?”   “Whatever it is, it’s my own, my good elves.  But if you wish ever to get back to your own  woods from this cold cheerless place,” he  answered shivering, “you will take me along  quick to a fire, where I can dry — and then you  will let me speak to your chiefs as quick as may  be. I have only an hour or two to spare.”    That is how it came about that some two hours     after his escape from the Gate, Bilbo was  sitting beside a warm fire in front of a large tent,  and there sat too, gazing curiously at him, both  the Elvenking and Bard. A hobbit in elvish  armour, partly wrapped in an old blanket, was  something new to them.   “Really you know,” Bilbo was saying in his  best business manner, “things are impossible.  Personally I am tired of the whole affair. I wish I  was back in the West in my own home, where  folk are more reasonable. But I have an interest  in this matter — one fourteenth share, to be  precise, according to a letter, which fortunately I  believe I have kept.” He drew from a pocket in  his old jacket (which he still wore over his mail),  crumpled and much folded, Thorin’s letter that  had been put under the clock on his  mantelpiece in May!   “A share in the profits, mind you,” he went  on. “I am aware of that. Personally I am only too  ready to consider all your claims carefully, and  deduct what is right from the total before putting  in my own claim. However you don’t know  Thorin Oakenshield as well as I do now. I  assure you, he is quite ready to sit on a heap of  gold and starve, as long as you sit here.”   “Well, let him!” said Bard. “Such a fool  deserves to starve.”   “Quite so,” said Bilbo. “I see your point of     view. At the same time winter is coming on fast.  Before long you will be having snow and what  not, and supplies will be difficult — even for elves  I imagine. Also there will be other difficulties.  You have not heard of Dain and the dwarves of  the Iron Hills?”   “We have, a long time ago; but what has he  got to do with us?” asked the king.   “I thought as much. I see I have some  information you have not got. Dain, I may tell  you, is now less than two days’ march off, and  has at least five hundred grim dwarves with him  — a good many of them have had experience in  the dreadful dwarf and goblin wars, of which you  have no doubt heard. When they arrive there  may be serious trouble.”   “Why do you tell us this? Are you betraying  your friends, or are you threatening us?” asked  Bard grimly.   “My dear Bard!” squeaked Bilbo. “Don’t be  so hasty! I never met such suspicious folk! I am  merely trying to avoid trouble for all concerned.  Now I will make you an offer! !”   “Let us hear it!” they said.   “You may see it!” said he. “It is this!” and he  drew forth the Arkenstone, and threw away the  wrapping.   The Elvenking himself, whose eyes were  used to things of wonder and beauty, stood up     in amazement. Even Bard gazed marvelling at it  in silence. It was as if a globe had been filled  with moonlight and hung before them in a net  woven of the glint of frosty stars.   “This is the Arkenstone of Thrain,” said  Bilbo, “the Heart of the Mountain; and it is also  the heart of Thorin. He values it above a river of  gold. I give it to you. It will aid you in your  bargaining.” Then Bilbo, not without a shudder,  not without a glance of longing, handed the  marvellous stone to Bard, and he held it in his  hand, as though dazed.   “But how is it yours to give?” he asked at  last with an effort.   “O well!” said the hobbit uncomfortably. “It  isn’t exactly; but, well, I am willing to let it stand  against all my claim, don’t you know. I may be a  burglar — or so they say: personally I never really  felt like one — but I am an honest one, I hope,  more or less. Anyway I am going back now, and  the dwarves can do what they like to me. I hope  you will find it useful.”   The Elvenking looked at Bilbo with a new  wonder. “Bilbo Baggins!” he said. “You are  more worthy to wear the armour of elf-princes  than many that have looked more comely in it.  But I wonder if Thorin Oakenshield will see it so.  I have more knowledge of dwarves in general  than you have perhaps. I advise you to remain     with us, and here you shall be honoured and  thrice welcome.”   “Thank you very much I am sure,” said Bilbo  with a bow. “But I don’t think I ought to leave my  friends like this, after all we have gone through  together. And I promised to wake old Bombur  at midnight, too! Really I must be going, and  quickly.”   Nothing they could say would stop him; so  an escort was provided for him, and as he went  both the king and Bard saluted him with honour.  As they passed through the camp an old man,  wrapped in a dark cloak, rose from a tent door  where he was sitting and came towards them.   “Well done! Mr. Baggins!” he said, clapping  Bilbo on the back. “There is always more about  you than anyone expects!” It was Gandalf.   For the first time for many a day Bilbo was  really delighted. But there was no time for all the  questions that he immediately wished to ask.   “All in good time!” said Gandalf. “Things are  drawing towards the end now, unless I am  mistaken. There is an unpleasant time just in  front of you; but keep your heart up! You may  come through all right. There is news brewing  that even the ravens have not heard. Good  night!”   Puzzled but cheered, Bilbo hurried on. He  was guided to a safe ford and set across dry,     and then he said farewell to the elves and  climbed carefully back towards the Gate. Great  weariness began to come over him; but it was  well before midnight when he clambered up the  rope again — it was still where he had left it. He  untied it and hid it, and then he sat down on the  wall and wondered anxiously what would  happen next.   At midnight he woke up Bombur; and then  in turn rolled himself up in his corner, without  listening to the old dwarfs thanks (which he felt  he had hardly earned). He was soon fast asleep  forgetting all his worries till the morning. As a  matter of fact he was dreaming of eggs and  bacon.      
Chapter XVII    THE CLOUDS BURST    Next day the trumpets rang early in the camp.  Soon a single runner was seen hurrying along  the narrow path. At a distance he stood and  hailed them, asking whether Thorin would now  listen to another embassy, since new tidings  had come to hand, and matters were changed.   “That will be Dain!” said Thorin when he  heard. “They will have got wind of his coming. I  thought that would alter their mood! Bid them  come few in number and weaponless, and I will  hear,” he called to the messenger.   About midday the banners of the Forest  and the Lake were seen to be borne forth  again. A company of twenty was approaching.  At the beginning of the narrow way they laid  aside sword and spear, and came on towards  the Gate. Wondering, the dwarves saw that  among them were both Bard and the Elvenking,  before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and    hood bore a strong casket of iron-bound wood.   “Hail Thorin!” said Bard. “Are you still of the  same mind?”   “My mind does not change with the rising  and setting of a few suns,” answered Thorin.  “Did you come to ask me idle questions? Still  the elf-host has not departed as I bade! Till then  you come in vain to bargain with me.”   “Is there then nothing for which you would  yield any of your gold?”   "Nothing that you or your friends have to  offer.”   “What of the Arkenstone of Thrain?” said  he, and at the same moment the old man  opened the casket and held aloft the jewel. The  light leapt from his hand, bright and white in the  morning.   Then Thorin was stricken dumb with  amazement and confusion. No one spoke for a  long while.   Thorin at length broke the silence, and his  voice was thick with wrath. “That stone was my  father’s, and is mine,” he said. “Why should I  purchase my own?” But wonder overcame him  and he added: “But how came you by the  heirloom of my house — if there is need to ask  such a question of thieves?”   “We are not thieves,” Bard answered. “Your  own we will give back in return for our own.”     “How came you by it?” shouted Thorin in  gathering rage.   “I gave it to them!” squeaked Bilbo, who  was peering over the wall, by now in a dreadful  fright.   “You! You!” cried Thorin, turning upon him  and grasping him with both hands. “You  miserable hobbit! You undersized — burglar!” he  shouted at a loss for words, and he shook poor  Bilbo like a rabbit.   “By the beard of Durin! I wish I had Gandalf  here! Curse him for his choice of you! May his  beard wither! As for you I will throw you to the  rocks!” he cried and lifted Bilbo in his arms.   “Stay! Your wish is granted!” said a voice.  The old man with the casket threw aside his  hood and cloak. “Here is Gandalf! And none too  soon it seems. If you don’t like my Burglar,  please don’t damage him. Put him down, and  listen first to what he has to say!”   “You all seem in league!” said Thorin  dropping Bilbo on the top of the wall. “Never  again will I have dealings with any wizard or his  friends. What have you to say, you descendant  of rats?”   “Dear me! Dear me!” said Bilbo. “I am sure  this is all very uncomfortable. You may  remember saying that I might choose my own  fourteenth share? Perhaps I took it too literally     — I have been told that dwarves are sometimes  politer in word than in deed. The time was, all  the same, when you seemed to think that I had  been of some service. Descendant of rats,  indeed! Is this all the service of you and your  family that I was promised, Thorin? Take it that I  have disposed of my share as I wished, and let  it go at that!”   “I will,” said Thorin grimly. “And I will let you  go at that — and may we never meet again!”  Then he turned and spoke over the wall. “I am  betrayed,” he said. “It was rightly guessed that I  could not forbear to redeem the Arkenstone, the  treasure of my house. For it I will give one  fourteenth share of the hoard in silver and gold,  setting aside the gems; but that shall be  accounted the promised share of this traitor,  and with that reward he shall depart, and you  can divide it as you will. He will get little enough,  I doubt not. Take him, if you wish him to live;  and no friendship of mine goes with him.   “Get down now to your friends!” he said to  Bilbo, “or I will throw you down.”   “What about the gold and silver?” asked  Bilbo.   “That shall follow after, as can be arranged,”  said he. “Get down!”   “Until then we keep the stone,” cried Bard.   “You are not making a very splendid figure     as King under the Mountain,” said Gandalf. “But  things may change yet.”   “They may indeed,” said Thorin. And  already, so strong was the bewilderment of the  treasure upon him, he was pondering whether  by the help of Dain he might not recapture the  Arkenstone and withhold the share of the  reward.   And so Bilbo was swung down from the  wall, and departed with nothing for all his  trouble, except the armour which Thorin had  given him already. More than one of the  dwarves in their hearts felt shame and pity at  his going.   “Farewell!” he cried to them. “We may meet  again as friends.”   “Be off!” called Thorin. “You have mail upon  you, which was made by my folk, and is too  good for you. It cannot be pierced by arrows;  but if you do not hasten, I will sting your  miserable feet. So be swift!”   "Not so hasty!” said Bard. “We will give you  until tomorrow. At noon we will return, and see if  you have brought from the hoard the portion that  is to be set against the stone. If that is done  without deceit, then we will depart, and the elf-  host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile  farewell!”   With that they went back to the camp; but     Thorin sent messengers by Roac telling Dain of  what had passed, and bidding him come with  wary speed.    That day passed and the night. The next day the  wind shifted west, and the air was dark and  gloomy. The morning was still early when a cry  was heard in the camp. Runners came in to  report that a host of dwarves had appeared  round the eastern spur of the Mountain and was  now hastening to Dale. Dain had come. He had  hurried on through the night, and so had come  upon them sooner than they had expected.  Each one of his folk was clad in a hauberk of  steel mail that hung to his knees, and his legs  were covered with hose of a fine and flexible  metal mesh, the secret of whose making was  possessed by Dain’s people. The dwarves are  exceedingly strong for their height, but most of  these were strong even for dwarves. In battle  they wielded heavy two-handed mattocks; but  each of them had also a short broad sword at  his side and a roundshield slung at his back.  Their beards were forked and plaited and thrust  into their belts. Their caps were of iron and they  were shod with iron, and their faces were grim.   Trumpets called men and elves to arms.     Before long the dwarves could be seen coming  up the valley at a great pace. They halted  between the river and the eastern spur; but a  few held on their way, and crossing the river  drew near the camp; and there they laid down  their weapons and held up their hands in sign of  peace. Bard went out to meet them, and with  him went Bilbo.   “We are sent from Dain son of Nain,” they  said when questioned. “We are hastening to  our kinsmen in the Mountain, since we learn that  the kingdom of old is renewed. But who are you  that sit in the plain as foes before defended  walls?” This, of course, in the polite and rather  old-fashioned language of such occasions,  meant simply: “You have no business here. We  are going on, so make way or we shall fight  you!” They meant to push on between the  Mountain and the loop of the river; for the  narrow land there did not seem to be strongly  guarded.   Bard, of course, refused to allow the  dwarves to go straight on to the Mountain. He  was determined to wait until the gold and silver  had been brought out in exchange for the  Arkenstone; for he did not believe that this  would be done, if once the fortress was manned  with so large and warlike a company. They had  brought with them a great store of supplies; for     the dwarves can carry very heavy burdens, and  nearly all of Dain’s folk, in spite of their rapid  march, bore huge packs on their backs in  addition to their weapons. They would stand a  siege for weeks, and by that time yet more  dwarves might come, and yet more, for Thorin  had many relatives. Also they would be able to  reopen and guard some other gate, so that the  besiegers would have to encircle the whole  mountain; and for that they had not sufficient  numbers.   These were, in fact, precisely their plans  (for the raven-messengers had been busy  between Thorin and Dain); but for the moment  the way was barred, so after angry words the  dwarf-messengers retired muttering in their  beards. Bard then sent messengers at once to  the Gate; but they found no gold or payment.  Arrows came forth as soon as they were within  shot, and they hastened back in dismay. In the  camp all was now astir, as if for battle; for the  dwarves of Dain were advancing along the  eastern bank.   “Fools!” laughed Bard, “to come thus  beneath the Mountain’s arm! They do not  understand war above ground, whatever they  may know of battle in the mines. There are  many of our archers and spearmen now hidden  in the rocks upon their right flank. Dwarf-mail     may be good, but they will soon be hard put to  it. Let us set on them now from both sides,  before they are fully rested!”   But the Elvenking said: “Long will I tarry, ere  I begin this war for gold. The dwarves cannot  pass us, unless we will, or do anything that we  cannot mark. Let us hope still for something that  will bring reconciliation. Our advantage in  numbers will be enough, if in the end it must  come to unhappy blows.”   But he reckoned without the dwarves. The  knowledge that the Arkenstone was in the  hands of the besiegers burned in their thoughts;  also they guessed the hesitation of Bard and  his friends, and resolved to strike while they  debated.   Suddenly without a signal they sprang  silently forward to attack. Bows twanged and  arrows whistled; battle was about to be joined.   Still more suddenly a darkness came on  with dreadful swiftness! A black cloud hurried  over the sky. Winter thunder on a wild wind  rolled roaring up and rumbled in the Mountain,  and lightning lit its peak. And beneath the  thunder another blackness could be seen  whirling forward; but it did not come with the  wind, it came from the North, like a vast cloud of  birds, so dense that no light could be seen  between their wings.     “Halt!” cried Gandalf, who appeared  suddenly, and stood alone, with arms uplifted,  between the advancing dwarves and the ranks  awaiting them. “Halt!” he called in a voice like  thunder, and his staff blazed forth with a flash  like the lightning. “Dread has come upon you  all! Alas! it has come more swiftly than I  guessed. The Goblins are upon you! Bolg- of  the North is coming, O Dain! whose father you  slew in Moria. Behold! the bats are above his  army like a sea of locusts. They ride upon  wolves and Wargs are in their train!”   Amazement and confusion fell upon them  all. Even as Gandalf had been speaking the  darkness grew. The dwarves halted and gazed  at the sky. The elves cried out with many voices.   “Come!” called Gandalf. “There is yet time  for council. Let Dain son of Nain come swiftly to  us!”    So began a battle that none had expected; and  it was called the Battle of Five Armies, and it  was very terrible. Upon one side were the  Goblins and the Wild Wolves, and upon the  other were Elves and Men and Dwarves. This is  how it fell out. Ever since the fall of the Great  Goblin of the Misty Mountains the hatred of their    race for the dwarves had been rekindled to fury.  Messengers had passed to and fro between all  their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they  resolved now to win the dominion of the North.  Tidings they had gathered in secret ways; and  in all the mountains there was a forging and an  arming. Then they marched and gathered by hill  and valley, going ever by tunnel or under dark,  until around and beneath the great mountain  Gundabad of the North, where was their capital,  a vast host was assembled ready to sweep  down in time of storm unawares upon the  South. Then they learned of the death of  Smaug, and joy was in their hearts; and they  hastened night after night through the  mountains, and came thus at last on a sudden  from the North hard on the heels of Dain. Not  even the ravens knew of their coming until they  came out in the broken lands which divided the  Lonely Mountain from the hills behind. How  much Gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is  plain that he had not expected this sudden  assault.   This is the plan that he made in council with  the Elven-king and with Bard; and with Dain, for  the dwarf-lord now joined them: the Goblins  were the foes of all, and at their coming all other  quarrels were forgotten. Their only hope was to  lure the goblins into the valley between the arms     of the Mountain; and themselves to man the  great spurs that struck south and east. Yet this  would be perilous, if the goblins were in  sufficient numbers to overrun the Mountain  itself, and so attack them also from behind and  above; but there was no time to make any other  plan, or to summon any help.   Soon the thunder passed, rolling away to  the South-East; but the bat-cloud came, flying  lower, over the shoulder of the Mountain, and  whirled above them shutting out the light and  filling them with dread.   “To the Mountain!” called Bard. “To the  Mountain! Let us take our places while there is  yet time!”   On the Southern spur, in its lower slopes  and in the rocks at its feet, the Elves were set;  on the Eastern spur were men and dwarves.  But Bard and some of the nimblest of men and  elves climbed to the height of the Eastern  shoulder to gain a view to the North. Soon they  could see the lands before the Mountain’s feet  black with a hurrying multitude. Ere long the  vanguard swirled round the spur’s end and  came rushing into Dale. These were the  swiftest wolf-riders, and already their cries and  howls rent the air afar. A few brave men were  strung before them to make a feint of  resistance, and many there fell before the rest     drew back and fled to either side. As Gandalf  had hoped, the goblin army had gathered  behind the resisted vanguard, and poured now  in rage into the valley, driving wildly up between  the arms of the Mountain, seeking for the foe.  Their banners were countless, black and red,  and they came on like a tide in fury and  disorder.   It was a terrible battle. The most dreadful of  all Bilbo’s experiences, and the one which at  the time he hated most — which is to say it was  the one he was most proud of, and most fond of  recalling long afterwards, although he was quite  unimportant in it. Actually I may say he put on  his ring early in the business, and vanished  from sight, if not from all danger. A magic ring  of that sort is not a complete protection in a  goblin charge, nor does it stop flying arrows  and wild spears; but it does help in getting out  of the way, and it prevents your head from being  specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a  goblin swordsman.   The elves were the first to charge. Their  hatred for the goblins is cold and bitter. Their  spears and swords shone in the gloom with a  gleam of chill flame, so deadly was the wrath of  the hands that held them. As soon as the host of  their enemies was dense in the valley, they sent  against it a shower of arrows, and each     flickered as it fled as if with stinging fire. Behind  the arrows a thousand of their spearmen leapt  down and charged. The yells were deafening.  The rocks were stained black with goblin blood.   Just as the goblins were recovering from  the onslaught and the elf-charge was halted,  there rose from across the valley a deep-  throated roar. With cries of “Moria!” and “Dain,  Dain!” the dwarves of the Iron Hills plunged in,  wielding their mattocks, upon the other side;  and beside them came the men of the Lake  with long swords.   Panic came upon the Goblins; and even as  they turned to meet this new attack, the elves  charged again with renewed numbers. Already  many of the goblins were flying back down the  river to escape from the trap; and many of their  own wolves were turning upon them and  rending the dead and the wounded. Victory  seemed at hand, when a cry rang out on the  heights above.   Goblins had scaled the Mountain from the  other side and already many were on the  slopes above the Gate, and others were  streaming down recklessly, heedless of those  that fell screaming from cliff and precipice, to  attack the spurs from above. Each of these  could be reached by paths that ran down from  the main mass of the Mountain in the centre;     and the defenders had too few to bar the way  for long. Victory now vanished from hope. They  had only stemmed the first onslaught of the  black tide.   Day drew on. The goblins gathered again in  the valley. There a host of Wargs came  ravening and with them came the bodyguard of  Bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars of  steel. Soon actual darkness was coming into a  stormy sky; while still the great bats swirled  about the heads and ears of elves and men, or  fastened vampire-like on the stricken. Now  Bard was fighting to defend the Eastern spur,  and yet giving slowly back; and the elf-lords  were at bay about their king upon the southern  arm, near to the watch-post on Ravenhill.   Suddenly there was a great shout, and from  the Gate came a trumpet call. They had  forgotten Thorin! Part of the wall, moved by  levers, fell outward with a crash into the pool.  Out leapt the King under the Mountain, and his  companions followed him. Hood and cloak  were gone; they were in shining armour, and  red light leapt from their eyes. In the gloom the  great dwarf gleamed like gold in a dying fire.   Rocks were hurled down from on high by  the goblins above; but they held on, leapt down  to the falls’ foot, and rushed forward to battle.  Wolf and rider fell or fled before them. Thorin     wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and  nothing seemed to harm him.   “To me! To me! Elves and Men! To me! O  my kinsfolk!” he cried, and his voice shook like  a horn in the valley.   Down, heedless of order, rushed all the  dwarves of Dain to his help. Down too came  many of the Lake-men, for Bard could not  restrain them; and out upon the other side came  many of the spearmen of the elves. Once again  the goblins were stricken in the valley; and they  were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and  hideous with their corpses. The Wargs were  scattered and Thorin drove right against the  bodyguard of Bolg. But he could not pierce their  ranks.   Already behind him among the goblin dead  lay many men and many dwarves, and many a  fair elf that should have lived yet long ages  merrily in the wood. And as the valley widened  his onset grew ever slower. His numbers were  too few. His flanks were unguarded. Soon the  attackers were attacked, and they were forced  into a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all  about with goblins and wolves returning to the  assault. The bodyguard of Bolg came howling  against them, and drove in upon their ranks like  waves upon cliffs of sand. Their friends could  not help them, for the assault from the Mountain     was renewed with redoubled force, and upon  either side men and elves were being slowly  beaten down.   On all this Bilbo looked with misery. He had  taken his stand on Ravenhill among the Elves —  partly because there was more chance of  escape from that point, and partly (with the  more Tookish part of his mind) because if he  was going to be in a last desperate stand, he  preferred on the whole to defend the Elvenking.  Gandalf, too, I may say, was there, sitting on the  ground as if in deep thought, preparing, I  suppose, some last blast of magic before the  end.   That did not seem far off. “It will not be long  now,” thought Bilbo, “before the goblins win the  Gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down  and captured. Really it is enough to make one  weep, after all one has gone through. I would  rather old Smaug had been left with all the  wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures  should get it, and poor old Bombur, and Balin  and Fili and Kili and all the rest come to a bad  end; and Bard too, and the Lake-men and the  merry elves. Misery me! I have heard songs of  many battles, and I have always understood that  defeat may be glorious. It seems very  uncomfortable, not to say distressing. I wish I  was well out of it.”     The clouds were torn by the wind, and a red  sunset slashed the West. Seeing the sudden  gleam in the gloom Bilbo looked round. He  gave a great cry: he had seen a sight that made  his heart leap, dark shapes small yet majestic  against the distant glow.   “The Eagles! The Eagles!” he shouted. “The  Eagles are coming!”   Bilbo’s eyes were seldom wrong. The  eagles were coming down the wind, line after  line, in such a host as must have gathered from  all the eyries of the North.   “The Eagles! the Eagles!” Bilbo cried,  dancing and waving his arms. If the elves could  not see him they could hear him. Soon they too  took up the cry, and it echoed across the valley.  Many wondering eyes looked up, though as yet  nothing could be seen except from the southern  shoulders of the Mountain.   “The Eagles!” cried Bilbo once more, but at  that moment a stone hurtling from above smote  heavily on his helm, and he fell with a crash and  knew no more.      
Chapter XVIII    THE RETURN JOURNEY    When Bilbo came to himself, he was literally by  himself. He was lying on the flat stones of  Ravenhill, and no one was near. A cloudless  day, but cold, was broad above him. He was  shaking, and as chilled as stone, but his head  burned with fire.   "Now I wonder what has happened?” he  said to himself. “At any rate I am not yet one of  the fallen heroes; but I suppose there is still time  enough for that!”   He sat up painfully. Looking into the valley  he could see no living goblins. After a while as  his head cleared a little, he thought he could  see elves moving in the rocks below. He  rubbed his eyes. Surely there was a camp still  in the plain some distance off; and there was a  coming and going about the Gate? Dwarves  seemed to be busy removing the wall. But all  was deadly still. There was no call and no echo    of a song. Sorrow seemed to be in the air.   “Victory after all, I suppose!” he said, feeling  his aching head. “Well, it seems a very gloomy  business.”   Suddenly he was aware of a man climbing  up and coming towards him.   “Hullo there!” he called with a shaky voice.  “Hullo there! What news?”   “What voice is it that speaks among the  stones?” said the man halting and peering  about him not far from where Bilbo sat.   Then Bilbo remembered his ring! “Well I’m  blessed!” said he. “This invisibility has its  drawbacks after all. Otherwise I suppose I might  have spent a warm and comfortable night in  bed!”   “It’s me, Bilbo Baggins, companion of  Thorin!” he cried, hurriedly taking off the ring.   “It is well that I have found you!” said the  man striding forward. “You are needed and we  have looked for you long. You would have been  numbered among the dead, who are many, if  Gandalf the wizard had not said that your voice  was last heard in this place. I have been sent to  look here for the last time. Are you much hurt?”   “A nasty knock on the head, I think,” said  Bilbo. “But I have a helm and a hard skull. All the  same I feel sick and my legs are like straws.”   “I will carry you down to the camp in the     valley,” said the man, and picked him lightly up.   The man was swift and sure-footed. It was  not long before Bilbo was set down before a  tent in Dale; and there stood Gandalf, with his  arm in a sling. Even the wizard had not  escaped without a wound; and there were few  unharmed in all the host.   When Gandalf saw Bilbo, he was delighted.  “Baggins!” he exclaimed. “Well I never! Alive  after all — I am glad! I began to wonder if even  your luck would see you through! A terrible  business, and it nearly was disastrous. But  other news can wait. Come!” he said more  gravely. “You are called for;” and leading the  hobbit he took him within the tent.   “Hail! Thorin,” he said as he entered. “I have  brought him.”   There indeed lay Thorin Oakenshield,  wounded with many wounds, and his rent  armour and notched axe were cast upon the  floor. He looked up as Bilbo came beside him.   “Farewell, good thief,” he said. “I go now to  the halls of waiting to sit beside my fathers, until  the world is renewed. Since I leave now all gold  and silver, and go where it is of little worth, I  wish to part in friendship from you, and I would  take back my words and deeds at the Gate.”   Bilbo knelt on one knee filled with sorrow.  “Farewell, King under the Mountain!” he said.     “This is a bitter adventure, if it must end so; and  not a mountain of gold can amend it. Yet I am  glad that I have shared in your perils — that has  been more than any Baggins deserves.”   “No!” said Thorin. “There is more in you of  good than you know, child of the kindly West.  Some courage and some wisdom, blended in  measure. If more of us valued food and cheer  and song above hoarded gold, it would be a  merrier world. But sad or merry, I must leave it  now. Farewell!”   Then Bilbo turned away, and he went by  himself, and sat alone wrapped in a blanket,  and, whether you believe it or not, he wept until  his eyes were red and his voice was hoarse.  He was a kindly little soul. Indeed it was long  before he had the heart to make a joke again.  “A mercy it is,” he said at last to himself, “that I  woke up when I did. I wish Thorin were living,  but I am glad that we parted in kindness. You  are a fool, Bilbo Baggins, and you made a  great mess of that business with the stone; and  there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to  buy peace and quiet, but I suppose you can  hardly be blamed for that.”    All that had happened after he was stunned,     Bilbo learned later; but it gave him more sorrow  than joy, and he was now weary of his  adventure. He was aching in his bones for the  homeward journey That, however, was a little  delayed, so in the meantime I will tell something  of events. The Eagles had long had suspicion  of the goblins’ mustering; from their  watchfulness the movements in the mountains  could not be altogether hid. So they too had  gathered in great numbers, under the great  Eagle of the Misty Mountains; and at length  smelling battle from afar they had come  speeding down the gale in the nick of time.  They it was who dislodged the goblins from the  mountain-slopes, casting them over precipices,  or driving them down shrieking and bewildered  among their foes. It was not long before they  had freed the Lonely Mountain, and elves and  men on either side of the valley could come at  last to the help of the battle below.   But even with the Eagles they were still  outnumbered. In that last hour Beorn himself  had appeared — no one knew how or from  where. He came alone, and in bear’s shape;  and he seemed to have grown almost to giant-  size in his wrath.   The roar of his voice was like drums and  guns; and he tossed wolves and goblins from  his path like straws and feathers. He fell upon     their rear, and broke like a clap of thunder  through the ring. The dwarves were making a  stand still about their lords upon a low rounded  hill. Then Beorn stooped and lifted Thorin, who  had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him  out of the fray.   Swiftly he returned and his wrath was  redoubled, so that nothing could withstand him,  and no weapon seemed to bite upon him. He  scattered the bodyguard, and pulled down Bolg  himself and crushed him. Then dismay fell on  the Goblins and they fled in all directions. But  weariness left their enemies with the coming of  new hope, and they pursued them closely, and  prevented most of them from escaping where  they could. They drove many of them into the  Running River, and such as fled south or west  they hunted into the marshes about the Forest  River; and there the greater part of the last  fugitives perished, while those that came hardly  to the Wood-elves’ realm were there slain, or  drawn in to die deep in the trackless dark of  Mirkwood. Songs have said that three parts of  the goblin warriors of the North perished on that  day, and the mountains had peace for many a  year.   Victory had been assured before the fall of  night; but the pursuit was still on foot, when  Bilbo returned to the camp; and not many were     in the valley save the more grievously wounded.   “Where are the Eagles?” he asked Gandalf  that evening, as he lay wrapped in many warm  blankets.   “Some are in the hunt,” said the wizard, “but  most have gone back to their eyries. They  would not stay here, and departed with the first  light of morning. Dain has crowned their chief  with gold, and sworn friendship with them  forever.”   “I am sorry. I mean, I should have liked to  see them again,” said Bilbo sleepily; “perhaps I  shall see them on the way home. I suppose I  shall be going home soon?”   “As soon as you like,” said the wizard.   Actually it was some days before Bilbo  really set out. They buried Thorin deep beneath  the Mountain, and Bard laid the Arkenstone  upon his breast.   “There let it lie till the Mountain falls!” he  said. “May it bring good fortune to all his folk  that dwell here after!”   Upon his tomb the Elvenking then laid  Orcrist, the elvish sword that had been taken  from Thorin in captivity. It is said in songs that it  gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached,  and the fortress of the dwarves could not be  taken by surprise. There now Dain son of Nain  took up his abode, and he became King under     the Mountain, and in time many other dwarves  gathered to his throne in the ancient halls. Of  the twelve companions of Thorin, ten remained.  Fili and Kili had fallen defending him with shield  and body, for he was their mother’s elder  brother. The others remained with Dain; for  Dain dealt his treasure well.   There was, of course, no longer any  question of dividing the hoard in such shares as  had been planned, to Balin and Dwalin, and  Dori and Nori and Ori, and Oin and Gloin, and  Bifur and Bofur and Bombur — or to Bilbo. Yet a  fourteenth share of all the silver and gold,  wrought and unwrought, was given up to Bard;  for Dain said: “We will honour the agreement of  the dead, and he has now the Arkenstone in his  keeping.”   Even a fourteenth share was wealth  exceedingly great, greater than that of many  mortal kings. From that treasure Bard sent  much gold to the Master of Lake-town; and he  rewarded his followers and friends freely. To the  Elvenking he gave the emeralds of Girion, such  jewels as he most loved, which Dain had  restored to him.   To Bilbo he said: “This treasure is as much  yours as it is mine; though old agreements  cannot stand, since so many have a claim in its  winning and defence. Yet even though you were     willing to lay aside all your claim, I should wish  that the words of Thorin, of which he repented,  should not prove true: that we should give you  little. I would reward you most richly of all.”   “Very kind of you,” said Bilbo. “But really it  is a relief to me. How on earth should I have got  all that treasure home without war and murder  all along the way, I don’t know. And I don’t know  what I should have done with it when I got home.  I am sure it is better in your hands.”   In the end he would only take two small  chests, one filled with silver, and the other with  gold, such as one strong pony could carry. “That  will be quite as much as I can manage,” said  he.   At last the time came for him to say good-  bye to his friends. “Farewell, Balin!” he said;  “and farewell, Dwalin; and farewell Dori, Nori,  Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur! May  your beards never grow thin!” And turning  towards the Mountain he added: “Farewell  Thorin Oakenshield! And Fili and Kili! May your  memory never fade!”   Then the dwarves bowed low before their  Gate, but words stuck in their throats. “Good-  bye and good luck, wherever you fare!” said  Balin at last. “If ever you visit us again, when our  halls are made fair once more, then the feast  shall indeed be splendid!”     “If ever you are passing my way,” said  Bilbo, “don’t wait to knock! Tea is at four; but  any of you are welcome at anytime!”   Then he turned away.    The elf-host was on the march; and if it was  sadly lessened, yet many were glad, for now the  northern world would be merrier for many a long  day. The dragon was dead, and the goblins  overthrown, and their hearts looked forward  after winter to a spring of joy.   Gandalf and Bilbo rode behind the  Elvenking, and beside them strode Beorn, once  again in man’s shape, and he laughed and  sang in a loud voice upon the road. So they  went on until they drew near to the borders of  Mirkwood, to the north of the place where the  Forest River ran out. Then they halted, for the  wizard and Bilbo would not enter the wood,  even though the king bade them stay a while in  his halls. They intended to go along the edge of  the forest, and round its northern end in the  waste that lay between it and the beginning of  the Grey Mountains. It was a long and cheerless  road, but now that the goblins were crushed, it  seemed safer to them than the dreadful  pathways under the trees. Moreover Beorn was     going that way too.   “Farewell! O Elvenking!” said Gandalf.  “Merry be the greenwood, while the world is yet  young! And merry be all your folk!”   “Farewell! O Gandalf!” said the king. “May  you ever appear where you are most needed  and least expected! The oftener you appear in  my halls the better shall I be pleased!”   “I beg of you,” said Bilbo stammering and  standing on one foot, “to accept this gift!” and  he brought out a necklace of silver and pearls  that Dain had given him at their parting.   “In what way have I earned such a gift, O  hobbit?” said the king.   “Well, er, I thought, don’t you know,” said  Bilbo rather confused, “that, er, some little return  should be made for your, er, hospitality. I mean  even a burglar has his feelings. I have drunk  much of your wine and eaten much of your  bread.”   “I will take your gift, O Bilbo the  Magnificent!” said the king gravely. “And I name  you elf-friend and blessed. May your shadow  never grow less (or stealing would be too easy)!  Farewell!”   Then the elves turned towards the Forest,  and Bilbo started on his long road home.     He had many hardships and adventures before  he got back. The Wild was still the Wild, and  there were many other things in it in those days  beside goblins; but he was well guided and well  guarded — the wizard was with him, and Beorn  for much of the way — and he was never in great  danger again. Anyway by midwinter Gandalf  and Bilbo had come all the way back, along  both edges of the Forest, to the doors of  Beorn’s house; and there for a while they both  stayed. Yule-tide was warm and merry there;  and men came from far and wide to feast at  Beorn’s bidding. The goblins of the Misty  Mountains were now few and terrified, and  hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and  the Wargs had vanished from the woods, so  that men went abroad without fear. Beorn  indeed became a great chief afterwards in  those regions and ruled a wide land between  the mountains and the wood; and it is said that  for many generations the men of his line had the  power of taking bear’s shape, and some were  grim men and bad, but most were in heart like  Beorn, if less in size and strength. In their day  the last goblins were hunted from the Misty  Mountains and a new peace came over the  edge of the Wild.   It was spring, and a fair one with mild     weathers and a bright sun, before Bilbo and  Gandalf took their leave at last of Beorn, and  though he longed for home, Bilbo left with  regret, for the flowers of the gardens of Beorn  were in springtime no less marvellous than in  high summer.   At last they came up the long road, and  reached the very pass where the goblins had  captured them before. But they came to that  high point at morning, and looking backward  they saw a white sun shining over the  outstretched lands. There behind lay Mirkwood,  blue in the distance, and darkly green at the  nearer edge even in the spring. There far away  was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of  eyesight. On its highest peak snow yet  unmelted was gleaming pale.   “So comes snow after fire, and even  dragons have their ending!” said Bilbo, and he  turned his back on his adventure. The Tookish  part was getting very tired, and the Baggins  was daily getting stronger. “I wish now only to  be in my own armchair!” he said.      
Chapter X IX    THE LAST STAGE    It was on May the First that the two came back  at last to the brink of the valley of Rivendell,  where stood the Last (or the First) Homely  House. Again it was evening, their ponies were  tired, especially the one that carried the  baggage; and they all felt in need of rest. As  they rode down the steep path, Bilbo heard the  elves still singing in the trees, as if they had not  stopped since he left; and as soon as the riders  came down into the lower glades of the wood  they burst into a song of much the same kind as  before. This is something like it:    The dragon is withered,   His bones are nowcrumbled;  His armour is shivered,   His splendour is humbled!  Though svnrd shall be rusted,  And throne and crown perish  With strength that men trusted  And wealth that they cherish,  Here grass is still growing,  And leaves are yet swinging,  The white water flowing,   And elves are yet singing   Come! Tra-la-la-lally!   Come back to the valley!    The stars are far brighter  Than gems without measure,  The moon is far whiter  Than silver in treasure;   The fire is more shining  On hearth in the gloaming  Than gold won by mining,   So why go a-roaming?   O! Tra-la-la-lally   Come back to the Valley.    O! Where are you going,   So late in returning?   The river is flowing,   The stars are all burning!  O! Whither so laden,   So sad and so dreary?  Here elf and elf-maiden  Nowwelcome the weary  With Tra-la-la-lally  Come back to the Valley,  Tra-la-la-lally  Fa-1 a-la-l ally  Fa-la!    Then the elves of the valley came out and  greeted them and led them across the water to  the house of Elrond. There a warm welcome  was made them, and there were many eager  ears that evening to hear the tale of their  adventures. Gandalf it was who spoke, for Bilbo  was fallen quiet and drowsy. Most of the tale he  knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told  much of it to the wizard on their homeward way  or in the house of Beorn; but every now and  again he would open one eye, and listen, when  a part of the story which he did not yet know  came in.     It was in this way that he learned where  Gandalf had been to; for he overheard the  words of the wizard to Elrond. It appeared that  Gandalf had been to a great council of the white  wizards, masters of lore and good magic; and  that they had at last driven the Necromancer  from his dark hold in the south of Mirkwood.   “Ere long now,” Gandalf was saying, “the  Forest will grow somewhat more wholesome.  The North will be freed from that horror for many  long years, I hope. Yet I wish he were banished  from the world!”   “It would be well indeed,” said Elrond; “but I  fear that will not come about in this age of the  world, or for many after.”   When the tale of their journeyings was told,  there were other tales, and yet more tales, tales  of long ago, and tales of new things, and tales  of no time at all, till Bilbo’s head fell forward on  his chest, and he snored comfortably in a  corner.   He woke to find himself in a white bed, and  the moon shining through an open window.  Below it many elves were singing loud and  clear on the banks of the stream.    Sing all ye joyful, nowsing all together!  The t fund’s in the tree-top, the wind’s in the  heather;   The stars are in blossom, the moon is in  flower,   And bright are the windows of Night in her  tower.    Dance all ye joyful, now dance all  together!   Soft is the grass, and let foot be like  feather!   The river is silver, the shadows are  fleeting;     Merry is May-time, and merry our  meeting.    Sing we now softly, and dreams let us  v\eave him!   Wind him in slumber and there let us  leave him!   The wanderer sleepeth. Now soft be his  pillow/.   Lullaby! Lullaby! Alder and Willow/    Sigh no more Pine, till the wind of the  mom!   Fall Moon! Dark be the land!   Hush! Hush! Oak, Ash, and Thom!  Hushed be all water, till dawn is at hand!    “Well, Merry People!” said Bilbo looking  out. “What time by the moon is this? Your lullaby  would waken a drunken goblin! Yet I thank you.”   “And your snores would waken a stone  dragon — yet we thank you,” they answered with  laughter. “It is drawing towards dawn, and you  have slept now since the night’s beginning.  Tomorrow, perhaps, you will be cured of  weariness.”   “A little sleep does a great cure in the  house of Elrond,” said he; “but I will take all the  cure I can get. A second good night, fair  friends!” And with that he went back to bed and  slept till late morning.   Weariness fell from him soon in that house,  and he had many a merry jest and dance, early  and late, with the elves of the valley. Yet even  that place could not long delay him now, and he  thought always of his own home. After a week,     therefore, he said farewell to Elrond, and giving  him such small gifts as he would accept, he  rode away with Gandalf.   Even as they left the valley the sky darkened  in the West before them, and wind and rain  came up to meet them.   “Merry is May-time!” said Bilbo, as the rain  beat into his face. “But our back is to legends  and we are coming home. I suppose this is the  first taste of it.”   “There is a long road yet,” said Gandalf.   “But it is the last road,” said Bilbo.   They came to the river that marked the very  edge of the borderland of the Wild, and to the  ford beneath the steep bank, which you may  remember. The water was swollen both with the  melting of the snows at the approach of  summer, and with the daylong rain; but they  crossed with some difficulty, and pressed  forward, as evening fell, on the last stage of  their journey.   This was much as it had been before,  except that the company was smaller, and more  silent; also this time there were no trolls. At  each point on the road Bilbo recalled the  happenings and the words of a year ago — it  seemed to him more like ten — so that, of  course, he quickly noted the place where the  pony had fallen in the river, and they had turned  aside for their nasty adventure with Tom and  Bert and Bill.   Not far from the road they found the gold of  the trolls, which they had buried, still hidden and  untouched. “I have enough to last me my time,”  said Bilbo, when they had dug it up. “You had  better take this, Gandalf. I daresay you can find  a use for it.”   “Indeed I can!” said the wizard. “But share  and share alike! You may find you have more  needs than you expect.”   So they put the gold in bags and slung them  on the ponies, who were not at all pleased     about it. After that their going was slower, for  most of the time they walked. But the land was  green and there was much grass through which  the hobbit strolled along contentedly. He  mopped his face with a red silk handkerchief —  no! not a single one of his own had survived, he  had borrowed this one from Elrond — for now  June had brought summer, and the weather  was bright and hot again.   As all things come to an end, even this  story, a day came at last when they were in  sight of the country where Bilbo had been born  and bred, where the shapes of the land and of  the trees were as well known to him as his  hands and toes. Coming to a rise he could see  his own Hill in the distance, and he stopped  suddenly and said:    Roads go ever ever on,   Over rock and under tree,   By caves wh ere never sun has shone,   By streams that never find the sea;  Over snow by winter sown,   And through the merry flowers of June,  Overgrass and over stone,   And under mountains in the moon.    Roads go ever ever on   Under cloud and under star,   Yet feet that wandering have gone  Turn at last to home afar.   Eyes that fire and s/ord have seen  And horror in the halls of stone  Look at last on meadows green   And trees and hills they long have  known.     Gandalf looked at him. “My dear Bilbo!” he  said. “Something is the matter with you! You are  not the hobbit that you were.”   And so they crossed the bridge and passed  the mill by the river and came right back to  Bilbo’s own door.   “Bless me! What’s going on?” he cried.  There was a great commotion, and people of all  sorts, respectable and unrespectable, were  thick round the door, and many were going in  and out — not even wiping their feet on the mat,  as Bilbo noticed with annoyance.   If he was surprised, they were more  surprised still. He had arrived back in the  middle of an auction! There was a large notice  in black and red hung on the gate, stating that  on June the Twenty-second Messrs Grubb,  Grubb, and Burrowes would sell by auction the  effects of the late Bilbo Baggins Esquire, of  Bag-End, Underhill, Hobbiton. Sale to  commence at ten o’clock sharp. It was now  nearly lunchtime, and most of the things had  already been sold, for various prices from next  to nothing to old songs (as is not unusual at  auctions). Bilbo’s cousins the Sackville-  Bagginses were, in fact, busy measuring his  rooms to see if their own furniture would fit. In  short Bilbo was “Presumed Dead”, and not  everybody that said so was sorry to find the  presumption wrong.   The return of Mr. Bilbo Baggins created  quite a disturbance, both under the Hill and over  the Hill, and across the Water; it was a great  deal more than a nine days’ wonder. The legal  bother, indeed, lasted for years. It was quite a  long time before Mr. Baggins was in fact  admitted to be alive again. The people who had  got specially good bargains at the Sale took a  deal of convincing; and in the end to save time  Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own  furniture. Many of his silver spoons mysteriously  disappeared and were never accounted for.     Personally he suspected the Sackville-  Bagginses. On their side they never admitted  that the returned Baggins was genuine, and  they were not on friendly terms with Bilbo ever  after. They really had wanted to live in his nice  hobbit-hole so very much.   Indeed Bilbo found he had lost more than  spoons — he had lost his reputation. It is true  that for ever after he remained an elf-friend, and  had the honour of dwarves, wizards, and all  such folk as ever passed that way; but he was  no longer quite respectable. He was in fact held  by all the hobbits of the neighbourhood to be  ‘queer’ — except by his nephews and nieces on  the Took side, but even they were not  encouraged in their friendship by their elders.   I am sorry to say he did not mind. He was  quite content; and the sound of the kettle on his  hearth was ever after more musical than it had  been even in the quiet days before the  Unexpected Party. His sword he hung over the  mantelpiece. His coat of mail was arranged on  a stand in the hall (until he lent it to a Museum).  His gold and silver was largely spent in  presents, both useful and extravagant — which to  a certain extent accounts for the affection of his  nephews and his nieces. His magic ring he  kept a great secret, for he chiefly used it when  unpleasant callers came.   He took to writing poetry and visiting the  elves; and though many shook their heads and  touched their foreheads and said “Poor old  Baggins!” and though few believed any of his  tales, he remained very happy to the end of his  days, and those were extraordinarily long.    One autumn evening some years afterwards  Bilbo was sitting in his study writing his  memoirs — he thought of calling them “There  and Back Again, a Hobbit’s Holiday” — when     there was a ring at the door. It was Gandalf and  a dwarf; and the dwarf was actually Balin.   “Come in! Come in!” said Bilbo, and soon  they were settled in chairs by the fire. If Balin  noticed that Mr. Baggins’ waistcoat was more  extensive (and had real gold buttons), Bilbo  also noticed that Balin’s beard was several  inches longer, and his jewelled belt was of great  magnificence.   They fell to talking of their times together, of  course, and Bilbo asked how things were going  in the lands of the Mountain. It seemed they  were going very well. Bard had rebuilt the town  in Dale and men had gathered to him from the  Lake and from South and West, and all the  valley had become tilled again and rich, and the  desolation was now filled with birds and  blossoms in spring and fruit and feasting in  autumn. And Lake-town was refounded and  was more prosperous than ever, and much  wealth went up and down the Running River;  and there was friendship in those parts  between elves and dwarves and men.      The Hall at Bag-End Residence of B.  Baggins Esquire    The old Master had come to a bad end.  Bard had given him much gold for the help of  the Lake-people, but being of the kind that  easily catches such disease he fell under the  dragon-sickness, and took most of the gold and  fled with it, and died of starvation in the Waste,     deserted by his companions.   “The new Master is of wiser kind,” said  Balin, “and very popular, for, of course, he gets  most of the credit for the present prosperity.  They are making songs which say that in his  day the rivers run with gold.”   “Then the prophecies of the old songs have  turned out to be true, after a fashion!” said  Bilbo.   “Of course!” said Gandalf. “And why should  not they prove true? Surely you don’t disbelieve  the prophecies, because you had a hand in  bringing them about yourself? You don’t really  suppose, do you, that all your adventures and  escapes were managed by mere luck, just for  your sole benefit? You are a very fine person,  Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you  are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after  all!”   “Thank goodness!” said Bilbo laughing, and  handed him the tobacco-jar.      mmma    ginrawira     WORKS BY J.R.R.
