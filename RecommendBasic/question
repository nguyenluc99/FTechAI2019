Thưa chị, em là Nguyễn Văn Lực, sinh viên có đến phòng Hợp tác Quốc tế để hỏi chị 1 số thông tin về học bổng Erasmus tới UMinho ạ.Lúc nãy em có đọc lại Guidelines for Application thì ở trang 13 em có thấy đề cập đến period của scholarship. Chị xem qua rồi hỏi giúp em mấy thông tin dưới đây ạ.Em cảm ơn.Sinh viên Nguyễn Văn LựcDear The International Relations Office of University of Minho.I am a third-year student of Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam.I reached your information about the Erasmus Scholarship program in our International Cooperation Office. After reading carefully all documents and guideline provided, I have some questions which I have not found out the accurate answers yet:1. When will the scholarship start, Spring 2020 or Autumn 2020, and how long does each last? If I apply for the Spring 2020 Erasmus Scholarship, while studying in your Institute, can I apply for another Erasmus Scholarship program for the next semesters, Autumn 2020 and Spring 2021 at another University in another country?2. My major is Information and Communication Technology, so can I learn Computer Science at your University? Does the scholarship include tuition fee for the whole semester? Do I have to pay any additional fee?3. Does I need any English certifications to apply this scholarship?Since the deadline for online submission is very soon, I hope that you can reply me as soon as possible so that I can decide to prepare document on time.Regards.Luc Nguyen Van.
